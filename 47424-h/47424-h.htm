    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. Guizot, in his
      History of England, states the Shakespearean problem in a few words, when
      he says: "Let us finally mention the great comedian, the great tragedian,
      the great philosopher, the great poet, who was in his lifetime butcher's
      apprentice, poacher, actor, theatrical manager, and whose name is William
      Shakespeare. In twenty years, amid the duties of his profession, the care
      of mounting his pieces, of instructing his actors, he composed the
      thirty-two tragedies and comedies, in verse and prose, rich with an
      incomparable knowledge of human nature, and an unequaled power of
      imagination, terrible and comic by turns, profound and delicate, homely
      and touching, responding to every emotion of the soul, divining all that
      was beyond the range of his experience and for ever remaining the treasure
      of the age&mdash;all this being accomplished, Shakespeare left the theater
      and the busy world, at the age of forty-five, to return to
      Stratford-on-Avon, where lived peacefully in the most modest retirement,
      writing nothing and never returning to the stage&mdash;ignored and unknown
      if his works had not forever marked out his place in the world&mdash;a
      strange example of an imagination so powerful, suddenly ceasing to
      produce, and closing, once for all, the door to the efforts of genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      But M. Guizot is very far from suggesting any prima facie inconsistency in
      this statement as it stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since every man reads the Shakespearean pages for himself and between the
      lines, much of what we are expected to accept as Shakespearean criticism
      must fail of universal appreciation and sympathy. But none who read the
      English tongue can well be unconcerned with the question as to <b>who
      wrote</b> those pages; and it would be affectation to deny that the
      intense realism of our day is offering some startling contributions to the
      solution of that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, the gentlemen of the "New Shakespeare Society" (whom Mr.
      Swinburne rather mercilessly burlesques in his recent "<i>Studies of
      Shakespeare</i>") submit these dramas to a quantitative analysis; and, by
      deliberately counting the "male," "female," "weak," and "stopped" endings,
      and the Alexandrines and catalectics (just as a mineralogist counts the
      degrees and minutes in the angles of his crystals), insist on their
      ability to pronounce didatically and infallibly what was written by
      William Shakespeare, and at what age; what was composed by Dekker,
      Fletcher, Marlowe, or anybody else; what was originally theirs, touched up
      by William Shakespeare or <i>vice versa</i>, etc. It is curious to observe
      how this process invariably gives all the admirable sentiments to William
      Shakespeare, and all the questionable ones to somebody else; but at least
      these New Shakespearean gentlemen have surrendered somewhat of the
      "cast-iron" theory of our childhood&mdash;that every page, line, and word
      of the immortal Shakespearean Drama was written by William Shakespeare
      demi-god, and by none other&mdash;perhaps, even opened a path through
      which the unbelievers may become, in due time, orthodox.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still, however, a great many persons who are disposed to wave
      the whole question behind them, much as Mr. Podsnap disposed of the social
      evil or a famine in India. It is only a "Historic Doubt," they say, and
      "Historic Doubts" are not rare, are mainly contrived to exhibit
      syllogistic ingenuity in the teeth of facts, etc., etc. The French, they
      say, have the same set of problems about Moli√®re. Was he a lawyer? was he
      a doctor? etc.&mdash;and they all find their material in internal evidence&mdash;e.
      g., an accurate handling of the technique of this or that profession or
      science: parallelism, practical coincidence, or something of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present work is an attempt to examine, for the benefit of these
      latter, from purely external evidence, a question which, dating only
      within the current quarter century, is constantly recurring to confront
      investigation, and, like Banquo's troublesome shade, seems altogether
      indisposed to "down."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to add my acknowledgments to Mr. Julian Norris, for his careful
      preparation of the Index to these pages.

      HE thirty-seven plays called, collectively, "Shakespeare," are a
      phenomenon, not only in English letters, but in human experience. The
      literature of the country to which they belong, had, up to the date of
      their appearance, failed to furnish, and has been utterly powerless since,
      to produce any type, likeness, or formative trace of them; while the
      literature of other nations possesses not even a corresponding type. The
      history of a century on either side of their era discloses, within the
      precints of their birth, no resources upon which levy could have been made
      for their creation. They came and went like a meteor; neither borrowing of
      what they found, nor loaning to what they left, their own peculiar and
      unapproachable magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unremitting researches of two centuries have only been able to assign
      their authorship (where it rested at first) to an hiatus in the life of a
      wayward village lad named William Shakespeare&mdash;who fled his native
      town penniless and before the constable, to return, in a few years, a
      well-to-do esquire&mdash;with a coat of arms and money in his pocket.
      <span class="pagenum">010</span><a name="link010" id="link010"></a>We have
      the history of the boy, and certain items as to the wealthy squire, who
      left behind him two or three exceedingly common-place and conventional
      epitaphs (said to be his handiwork) and a remarkable will; but, between
      them, no hint of history, chronicle, or record. Still, within this unknown
      period of this man's career, these matchless dramas came from somewhere,
      and passed current under his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of their reputed author attracted no contemporary attention, and
      for many years thereafter the dramas remained unnoticed. Although written
      in an idiom singularly open to the comprehension of all classes and
      periods of English-speaking men, no sooner did they begin to be remarked,
      than a cloud of what are politely called "commentators" bore down upon
      them; any one who could spell feeling at liberty to furnish a "reading;"
      and any one who supposed himself able to understand one of these
      "readings," to add a barnacle in the shape of a "note." From these
      "commentators" the stately text is even now in peril, and rarely, even
      to-day, can it be perused, except one line at a time, across the top of a
      dreary page of microscopic and exasperating annotation. But, up to within
      a very few years, hardly a handful of Shakespearean students had arisen
      with courage to admit&mdash;what scarcely any one of the "commentators"
      even, could have failed to perceive&mdash;the utterly inadequate source
      ascribed to the plays themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not yet thirty years since an American lady was supposed to have
      gone crazy because she declared that William Shakespeare, of the Globe and
      Black-friars theaters in London, in the days of Elizabeth, was not the
      author of these certain dramas and poems <span class="pagenum">011</span><a
      name="link011" id="link011"></a>for which&mdash;for almost three hundred
      years&mdash;he has stood sponsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bacon's "madness," indeed, has been rapidly contageous. Now-a-days,
      men make books to prove, not that William Shakespeare did not write these
      works, but that Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, or some other Elizabethan,
      did not. And we even find, now and then, a treatise written to prove that
      William Shakespeare was, after all, their author; an admission, at least,
      that the ancient presumption to that effect no longer covers the case.
      And, doubtless, the correct view is within this admission. For, probably,
      if permitted to examine this presumption by the tests which would be
      applied to any other question of fact, namely, the tests of contemporary
      history, muniments, and circumstantial evidence, it will be found to be
      quite as well established and proved that William Shakespeare was not the
      author of the plays that go by his name, as any other fact, occurring in
      London between the years 1585 and 1616, not recorded in history or handed
      down by tradition, could be established and proved in 1881.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a doubt as to the authorship of the plays had arisen at any time during
      or between those years, and had been kept open thereafter, the probability
      is that it would have been settled by this time. But, as it is, we may be
      pretty certain that no such doubt did arise, and that no such question was
      asked, during the years when those who could have dispelled the doubt or
      answered the question were living. When we are about to visit a theater in
      these days, what we ask and concern ourselves with is: Is the play
      entertaining? Does it "draw?" And, when we wit<span class="pagenum">012</span><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a>ness it, the question is: Do we enjoy it&mdash;or
      does it bore us? Will we recommend our friends to come that they may be
      entertained, too, and that we may discuss it with them? or will we warn
      them to keep away? We very speedily settle these questions for ourselves.
      Doubtless we may and do inquire who the author is. But we do not enter
      into any discussion upon the subject, or charge our minds enough with the
      matter to doubt it when we are told. The author's name is, not unusually,
      printed on the play-bill before us; we glance at it indifferently, take
      what is told us for granted, and think no more about it. If the name
      happens to be assumed, we may possibly see its identity discussed in the
      dramatic columns of our newspapers next morning, or we may not. If the
      play entertains us, we commend it. If it drags, we sneer at it, get up and
      go off. That is all the concern we give it. The evening has slipped away;
      and, with it, any idle speculations as to the playwright who has essayed
      to amuse us for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, three hundred years hence, a question as to who wrote the play we saw
      at Mr. Daly's theater or Mr. Wallack's theater last evening should come
      up, there would be very little evidence, not any records, and scarcely an
      exhibit to refer to in the matter. Copies of the play-bill or the
      newspapers of the day might chance to be discovered; but these&mdash;the
      internal testimony of the play itself, if any, and a sort of tacit
      presumption growing out of a statement it was nobody's cue to inquire into
      at the time it was made, and had been nobody's business to scrutinize
      since&mdash;would constitute all the evidence at hand. How this
      supposititious case is precisely all-fours with the facts <span
      class="pagenum">013</span><a name="link013" id="link013"></a>in the matter
      of the dramatic works which we call, collectively, Shakespeare's.
      Precisely: except that, on the evenings when those plays were acted, there
      were no play-bills, and, on the succeeding morning, no daily newspaper. We
      have, therefore, in 1881, much fewer facilities for setting ourselves
      right as to their authorship than those living three hundred years after
      us could possess in the case we have supposed. The audiences who witnessed
      a certain class of plays at Shakespeare's theaters, in the years between
      1585 and 1606, were entertained. The plays "drew." People talked of them
      about town, and they become valuable to their proprietors. The mimic lords
      and ladies were acceptable to the best seats; the rabble loved the show
      and glitter and the alarum of drums; and all were Britons who gloated over
      rehearsal of the prowess of their own kings and heroes, and to be told
      that their countrymen at Agincourt had slain ten thousand Frenchmen at an
      expense of but five and twenty of themselves. But, if M. Taine's
      description of the Shakespearean theaters and the audience therein wont to
      assemble may be relied upon, we can pretty safely conclude that they
      troubled themselves very little as to who fashioned the dialogue the
      counterfeit kings and queens, soldiers, lords, and ladies spoke; or that
      they saw any thing in that dialogue to make such speculation appear worth
      their while. Nor can we discover any evidence, even among the cultured
      courtiers who listened to them&mdash;or in the case of Elizabeth herself,
      who is said to have loved them (which we may as well admit for the
      argument's sake)&mdash;that any recognition of the plays as works worthy
      of any other than a stage-manager, occurred. <span class="pagenum">014</span><a
      name="link014" id="link014"></a>Even if it should appear that these plays
      thus performed were the plays we now call Shakespeare's; had any of this
      audience suspected that these plays were not written for them, but for all
      time; that, three hundred years later&mdash;when the plays should not only
      be extant, but more loved and admired than ever&mdash;the thinking world
      should set itself seriously to probe the mystery of their origin; there
      might have been some interest as to their producer manifested, and we
      might have had some testimony competent to the exact point to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is evident enough that no such prophetic vision was vouchsafed to
      them, and no such prophetic judgment passed. Nor is the phenomenon
      exceptional. The critic, does not live, even to-day, however learned or
      cultured or shrewd, who would take the responsibility of affirming upon
      his own judgment, or even upon the universal judgment of his age and race,
      that any literary composition would be, after a lapse of three hundred
      years, not only extant, but immortal, hugged as its birthright by a whole
      world. Such a statement would have been contrary to experience, beyond the
      prophecy of criticism, and therefore only to be known&mdash;if known at
      all&mdash;as a Fact. Moreover, it could only be known as a fact at the
      expiration of the three hundred years. Doubtless, few critics would care,
      in any case, to commit themselves upon record one way or the other in a
      matter so hypothetical and speculative as the judgment of posterity upon a
      literary performance, and certainly nothing of the sort occurred in
      Shakespeare's day, even if there were any dramatic or literary critics to
      speculate upon the subject. There can be no doubt&mdash;and it must be
      conceded <span class="pagenum">015</span><a name="link015" id="link015"></a>&mdash;that
      certain acted plays <i>did</i> pass with their first audiences, and that
      certain printed plays, both contemporaneously and for years thereafter,
      did pass with the public who read them, as the compositions of Mr. Manager
      Shakespeare; and that probably even the manager's pot companions, who had
      better call to know him than any others, saw nothing to shake their heads
      at in his claim to be their author (provided he ever made any such claim;
      which, by the way, does not appear from any record of his life, and which
      nobody ever asserted as a fact). If they did&mdash;with the exception only
      of Robert Greene&mdash;they certainly kept their own counsel. On the one
      hand, then, the question of the authorship was never raised, and, on the
      other hand, if it had been, the scholars and critics who studied the plays
      (supposing that there were any such in those days) could not possibly have
      recognized them as immortal. If they had so recognized them, they would
      doubtless have left us something more satisfactory as to the authorship of
      the compositions than the mere "impression that they were informed" that
      the manager of the theater where they were produced wrote them; that they
      supposed he was clever enough to have done so, and they therefore took it
      for granted that he did. That is all there is of the evidence of
      Shakespeare's own day, as to the question&mdash;if it still is a question&mdash;before
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how about the presumption&mdash;the legal presumption, arising from
      such lapse of time as that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary&mdash;the
      presumption springing from tradition and common report&mdash;that William
      Shakespeare composed the Shakespearean plays? It is, of course, understood
      that one presump<span class="pagenum">016</span><a name="link016"
      id="link016"></a>tion is as good as another until it is disturbed. It is
      never safe to underrate an existing presumption; as long as it stands at
      all, it stands as conclusive; once overthrown, however, it is as if it had
      never existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A presumption three hundred years old may be a strong one to overthrow.
      But if its age is all there is of it&mdash;if it be only strong in years&mdash;it
      can yet be toppled over. Once overthrown, it is no more venerable because
      it is three hundred years old than if it were only three. An egg-shell
      will toss upon the crest of an angry surf, and, for very frailty, outride
      breakers when the mightiest ship man ever framed could not survive an
      instant. But it is only an egg-shell, for all that, and a touch of the
      finger will crush and destroy it. And so, formidable as it was in age, the
      presumption as to William Shakespeare's authorship of the great dramas
      which for three hundred years had gone by his name, had only to be touched
      by the thumb and finger of common sense to crackle and shrivel like the
      egg that sat on the wall in the Kindergarten rhyme, which all the king's
      army and all the king's men could not set up again, once it had tumbled
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the world advanced and culture increased, why did not the question
      arise before? Simply because the times were not ripe for it. This is the
      age and generation for the explosion of myths, and, as one after another
      of them falls to pieces and disappears, who does not wonder that they have
      not fallen sooner? For how many years has the myth of William Tell been
      cherished as history! And yet there is no element of absolute
      impossibility or even of improbability&mdash;much less of miracle&mdash;in
      the story of an archer with a sure eye and a steady aim. Or, in the case
      of physical <span class="pagenum">017</span><a name="link017" id="link017"></a>myths&mdash;which
      only required an exploration by physical sense for their explosion&mdash;the
      maps of two centuries or so ago represented all inaccessible seas as
      swarming with krakens and ship-devouring reptiles. And it is not twenty
      years since children were taught in their geographies that upon the coast
      of Norway there was a whirlpool which sucked down ships prow foremost. And
      here, in our midst, a cannon-shot from where we sit and write these lines,
      there was believed to be and exist a Hell Gate which was a very portal of
      death and slaughter to hapless mariners. But there are no krakens, and not
      much of a Maelstrom; and, for twenty years before General Newton blew up a
      few rocks at Hell Gate, people had laughed at the myth of its ferocity.
      And again: nothing is easier than to invent a story so utterly unimportant
      and immaterial that it will be taken for granted, without controversy, and
      circulate with absolute immunity from examination, simply because worth
      nobody's while to contradict it. For example, it is likely enough that
      Demosthenes, in practicing oratory, stood on a sea-beach and drilled his
      voice to outroar the waves. The story is always told, however, with the
      rider, that Demosthenes did this with his mouth filled with pebble-stones;
      and, as nobody cares whether he did or not, nobody troubles himself to
      ascertain by experiment that the thing is impossible, and that nobody can
      roar with a mouth full of pebble-stones. And not even then would he
      succeed in removing the impression obtaining with the great mass of the
      world, that a thing is proven sufficiently if it gets into "print."
      Charles II. set the Royal Society of his day at work to <span
      class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>find the
      reason why a dead fish weighed more than a live one&mdash;and it was only
      when they gave it up, that the playful monarch assured them that the fact
      they were searching for the reason of was not a fact at all. It is not
      impossible to demonstrate from experience, that the human mind will be
      found&mdash;as a rule&mdash;to prefer wasting laborious days in accounting
      for, rather than take the very simplest pains to verify even a proposition
      or alleged fact, which, if a fact at all, is of value beyond itself. It
      was objected to the system of Copernicus, when first brought forward,
      that, if the earth turned on its axis as he represented, a stone dropped
      from the summit of a tower would not fall at the foot of it, but at a
      great distance to the west, in the same manner that a stone dropped from
      the masthead of a ship in full sail does not fall at the foot of the mast,
      but toward the stern. To this it was answered that a stone, being a part
      of the earth, obeys the same laws and moves with it, whereas it is no part
      of the ship, of which, consequently, its motion is independent. This
      solution was admitted by some and opposed by others, and the controversy
      went on with spirit; nor was it till one hundred years after the death of
      Copernicus that, the experiment being tried, it was ascertained that the
      stone thus dropped from the head of the mast does fall at the foot of it.
      And so, if, in the case of the Shakespearean authorship, the day has come
      for truth to dispel fiction, and reason to scout organic miracle, why
      should we decline to look into an alleged Shakespearean myth simply
      because it happens to be a little tardy in coming to the surface?

      But, most of all, it is to be remembered that it is, practically, only our
      own century that has compre<span class="pagenum">019</span><a

      of the "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," and the rest of those transcripts of
      nature, the prophetic insight of whose author "spanned the ages that were
      to roll up after him, mastered the highest wave of modern learning and
      discovery, and touched the heart of all time, not through the breathing of
      living characters, but by lifting mankind up ont of the loud kingdom of
      earth into the silent realm of infinity; who so wrote that to his
      all-seeing vision schools and libraries, sciences and philosophies, were
      unnecessary, because his own marvelous intuition had grasped all the past
      and seen through all his present and all his future, and because, before
      his superhuman power, time and space had vanished and disappeared." * The
      age for which the dramas were written had not come, in that Elizabethan

      The tongues of the actors were tied, the ears of the audience were deaf to
      syllables whose burden was for the centuries that were to come after. The
      time for the question, "Who wrote them?" was not yet. For two hundred
      years more&mdash;from the day of William Shakespeare's death down to years
      within the memory of those now living&mdash;down to at least the date of
      Lord Byron (who admits that it is the perfectly correct thing to call
      Shakespeare "god-like," "mighty," and the like, but very unfashionable to
      read him),&mdash;we may ransack the records of scholarship and criticism,
      and unearth scarcely a hint of what is now their every-where conceded
      superiority, to say nothing of their immortality. In short, we can not
      rise from such a search without understanding, very clearly in Fuller, in
      1622, chronicles that William Shakespeare's "genius was jocular," his
      comedies merry, and his tragedies wonderful; his wit quick, but that his
      learning was very little. Evelyn notes that, in 1661, he saw "Hamlet,
      Prince of Denmark," played: "but now the old plays begin to disgust this
      refined age, since His Majesty has been so long abroad." * Pepys, his
      contemporary, says that the "'Midsummer-Night's Dream' was the most
      insipid, ridiculous play he had ever seen.... and, but having lately read
      the 'Adventures of Five Hours,' 'Othello' seemed a mean thing," though he
      liked Davenant's opera of "Macbeth," with its music and dancing. ** When
      spending some money in books he looks over Shakespeare, but chooses
      "'Hudibras,' the book now in the greatest fashion for drollery," instead.
      It is doubtful if Milton ever read the Shakespearean plays, in spite of
      the eloquent verses, "What needs my Shakespeare," etc.; since, in
      "L'Allegro," he speaks of his (Shakespeare's) "native wood-notes wild."

      could say about his king in "The Iconoclast," was that Charles I. kept an

      John Dryden, in or about 1700, in his "Defence of the Epilogue," a
      postscript to his tragedy "The Conquest of Granada," says: "Let any man
      who understands English, read diligently the works of Shakespeare and
      Fletcher, and I dare undertake that he will find in every page either some
      solecism of speech, or some notorious flaw in sense; and yet these men are
      reverenced, when we are not forgiven." He denounces "the lameness of their
      plots," made up of some "ridiculous incoherent story,... either grounded
      on impossibilities, or, at least, he writes, in many places, below the
      dullest writers of our own or any precedent age." Of the audiences who
      could tolerate such matter, he says: "They knew no better, and therefore
      were satisfied with what they brought. Those who call theirs the 'Golden
      Age of Poetry,' have only this reason for it: that they were then content
      with acorns before they knew the use of bread," etc. * To show the world
      how William Shakespeare <i>should</i> have written, Mr. Dryden publishes
      his own improved version of "Troilus and Cressida," "with an abjectly
      fulsome dedication to the Earl of Sunderland, and a Preface," ** in which
      he is obliging enough to say that the style of Shakespeare being "so
      pestered with figurative expressions that it is as affected as it is
      obscure;" that, though "the author seems to have began it with some fire,
      the characters of 'Pandarus' and 'Troilus' are promising enough, but, as
      if he grew weary of his task, after an entrance or two, he lets 'em fall,
      and the latter part of the tragedy is nothing but a confusion of drums and
      trumpets, excursions and alarms. The chief persons who give name to the
      tragedy are left alive. 'Cressida' is left alive and is not punished."

      The same thing was done in 1672, by Ravenscroft, who produced an
      adaptation of "Titus Andronicus," and boasted "that none in all the
      author's works ever received greater alterations or additions; the
      language not only refined, but many scenes entirely new, besides most of
      the principal characters heightened, and the plot much increased." John
      Dennis, a critic of that day, declares that Shakespeare "knew nothing
      about the ancients, set all propriety at defiance,... was neither master
      of time enough to consider, correct, and polish what he had written,...
      his lines are utterly void of celestial fire," and his verses "frequently
      harsh and unmusical." He was, however, so interested in the erratic and
      friendless poet that he kindly altered "The Merry Wives of Windsor," and
      touched up "Coriolanus," which he brought out in 1720, under the title of
      "The Invader of his Country, or the Fatal Resentment." The play, however,
      did not prosper, and he attributed it to the fact that it was played on a
      Wednesday. Dean Swift, in his "The Narrative of Dr. Robert Norris,
      concerning the Strange and Deplorable Frenzy of John Dennis," relates how
      the said Dennis, being in company with Lintot, the bookseller, and
      Shakespeare being mentioned as of a contrary opinion to Mr. Dennis, the
      latter "swore the said Shakespeare was a rascal, with other defamatory
      expressions, which gave Mr. Lintot a very ill opinion of the said Shake<span

      Thomas Rymer knows exactly how Othello, which he calls "a bloody farce,
      the tragedy of the pocket-handkerchief," ought to have been done. In the
      first place, he is angry that the hero should be a black-a-moor, and that
      the army should be insulted by his being a soldier. Of "Desdemona" he
      says: "There is nothing in her which is not below any country kitchen-maid&mdash;no
      woman bred out of a pigstye could talk so meanly." Speaking of expression,
      he writes that "in the neighing of a horse or in the growling of a mastiff
      there is a meaning, there is as lively expression, and, I may say, more
      humanity, than in the tragical flights of Shakespeare." He is indignant
      that the catastrophe of the play should turn on a handkerchief. He would
      have liked it to have been folded neatly on the bridal couch, and, when
      Othello was killing Desde-mona, "the fairy napkin might have started up to
      disarm his fury and stop his ungracious mouth. Then might she, in a trance
      of fear, have lain for dead; then might he, believing her dead, and
      touched with remorse, have honestly cut his own throat, by the good leave
      and with the applause of all the spectators, who might thereupon have gone
      home with a quiet mind, and admiring the beauty of Providence freely and
      truly represented in the theater. Then for the unraveling, of the plot, as
      they call it, never was old <span class="pagenum">025</span><a
      name="link025" id="link025"></a>deputy recorder in a country town, with
      his spectacles on, summing up the evidence, at such a puzzle, so blundered
      and be doltified as is our poet to have a good riddance and get the
      catastrophe off his hands. What can remain with the audience to carry home
      with them? How can it work but to delude our senses, disorder our
      thoughts, scare our imaginations, corrupt our appetite, and till our head
      with vanity, confusion, tintamarre and jingle-jangle, beyond what all the
      parish clerks in London could ever pretend to?" He then hopes the audience
      will go to the play as they go to church, namely, "sit still, look on one
      another, make no reflection, nor mind the play more than they would a
      sermon." With regard to "Julius C√¶sar," he is displeased that Shakespeare
      should have meddled with the Romans. He might be "familiar with Othello
      and Iago as his own natural acquaintances, but C√¶sar and Brutus were above
      his conversation." To put them "in gulls' coats and make them
      Jack-puddens," is more than public decency should tolerate&mdash;in Mr.
      Rymer's eyes. Of the well-known scene between Brutus and Cassius, this
      critic remarks: "They are put there to play the bully and the buffoon, to
      show their activity of face and muscles. They are to play for a prize, a
      trial of skill and hugging and swaggering like two drunken Hectors for a
      twopenny reckoning." Rymer calls his book "A Short View of Tragedy, with
      Some Reflections on Shakespeare and Other Practitioners for the Stage."
      Hume thought that both Bacon and Shakespeare showed "a want of simplicity
      and purity of diction with defective taste and elegance," and that "a
      reasonable propriety of <span class="pagenum">026</span><a name="link026"
      id="link026"></a>thoughts he (Shakespeare) can not at any time uphold."
      Voltaire thought the Shakespearean kings "not completely royal." Pope (who
      declared that Rymer, just quoted, was "a learned and strict critic"), to
      show that he was not insensible to the occasional merits of the plays, was
      good enough to distinguish, by inverted commas, such passages as he
      thought might be safely admired by the rest of mankind; while Richard
      Steele, in "The Tatler," * borrows the story of the "Taming of the Shrew,"
      and narrates it as "an incident occurring in Lincolnshire," feeling, no
      doubt, that he did a good deed in rescuing whatever was worth preserving
      from the clutches of such obscure and obsolete literature!

      And then came the period when scholars and men of taste were ravished with
      Addison's stilted rhymes, and the six-footed platitudes of Pope, and the
      sesquepedalian derivatives dealt out by old Samuel Johnson. The
      Shakespearean plays are pronounced by Mr. Addison ** "very faulty in hard
      metaphors and forced expressions," and he joins them with "Xat. Lee," as
      "instances of the false sublime."

      Samuel Johnson is reported as saying that William Shakespeare never wrote
      six consecutive lines (he subsequently made it seven) without "making an
      ass of himself," (in which speech he seems to have followed his namesake
      without the "h," old Ben, in the "Discoveries")&mdash;backing up his
      assertion with some very choice specimens of literary criticism. Let any
      one, interested enough in <span class="pagenum">027</span><a name="link027"
      id="link027"></a>the matter to see for himself, take down Dr. Johnson's
      own edition of Shakespeare, and read his commentaries on the Shakespearean
      text. Let him turn, for example, to where he says of "Hamlet":
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>We must allow to the tragedy of "Hamlet" the praise of variety. The
      incidents are so numerous that the argument of the play would make a long
      tale. The scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and
      solemnity,... that includes judicious and instructive observations.... New
      characters appear from time to time in continual succession, exhibiting
      various forms of life and particular modes of conversation. The pretended
      madness of Hamlet causes much mirth;... the catastrophe is not very
      happily produced; the exchange of weapons is rather an expedient of
      necessity than a stroke of art. A scheme might easily be formed to kill
      Hamlet with the dagger and Laertes with the bowl.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, of "Macbeth":
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This play is deservedly celebrated for the propriety of its fiction,
      and solemnity, grandeur, and variety of its action, but it has no nice
      discriminations of character.... I know not whether it may not be said in
      defense of some parts which now seem improbable, that in Shakespeare's
      time it was necessary to warn credulity against vain and illusive
      predictions.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, of "Julius C√¶sar":
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Of this tragedy, many particular passages deserve regard, and the
      contention and reconcilement of Brutus and Cassius is universally
      celebrated. But I have never been strongly agitated in perusing it, and
      think it somewhat cold and unaffecting, etc.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Was "Hamlet" a low comedy part, in the days when all England bowed at the
      feet of an unkempt and mannerless old man, awed by the brilliancy of his
      literary judgment? And did Hamlet's "pretended madness" cause "much mirth"
      to the age, or only to <span class="pagenum">028</span><a name="link028"
      id="link028"></a>Samuel Johnson? People now-a-days do not sit and giggle
      over "the pretended madness of Hamlet." But, waiving these questions, let

      Let the reader look on a little further, and find this fossil-scanning
      machine telling off the spondees and dactyls in the dramas (to ascertain
      if the c√¶sura was exactly in the middle) on his fingers and thumbs, and
      counting the unities up to three, to see if he could approve of what the
      ages after him were to worship! if, haply, this Shakespeare (although he
      <i>might</i> have devised a scheme to kill Laertes with the bowl and
      Hamlet with the dagger, or <i>might</i> have thrown a little more fire
      into the quarrel with Brutus and Cassius) could be admitted to sit at the
      feet of Addison, with his sleepy and dreary "Campaign;" or Pope, with his
      metrical proverbs about "Man;" or even the aforesaid Samuel Johnson
      himself, with his rhymed dic<span class="pagenum">029</span><a
      name="link029" id="link029"></a>tionaries about the "vanity of human
      wishes," and so on. Let him find the old lexicographer admitting, in his
      gracious condescension, that "The Tempest" "is sufficiently regular;" of
      "Measure for Measure" that "the unities are sufficiently preserved;" that
      the "Midsummer Night's Dream" was "well written;" that the style of the
      "Merchant of Venice" was "easy:" but that in "As you Like It" "an
      opportunity of exhibiting a moral lesson" is unhappily lost. The "Winter's
      Tale" is "entertaining;" in "King John" he finds "a pleasing interchange
      of incidents and characters," remarking that "the lady's grief is very
      affecting." Of "Troilus and Cressida" the old formalist says, that it "is
      one of the most correctly written of Shakespeare's plays;" of
      "Coriolanus," that it "is one of the most amusing." But, he says, that
      "Antony and Cleopatra" is "low" and "without any art of connection or care
      of disposition." he dismisses "Cymbeline" with the remark that he does not
      care "to waste criticism upon unresisting imbecility; upon faults too
      evident for detection and too gross for aggravation." He is pleased to
      approve of "Romeo and Juliet," because "the incidents are numerous and
      important, the catastrophe irresistibly affecting, and the process of the
      action carried on with such probability, at least with such congruity to
      popular opinions, as tragedy requires" and, while on the whole, approving
      of "Othello," he can not help remarking that, "had the scene opened in
      Cyprus, and the preceding incidents been occasionally related, there had
      been little wanting to a drama of the most exact and scrupulous
      regularity." And so on every-where! Let the reader imagine one thus
      patronizing these mighty and deathless monographs to-day! Let him <span
      class="pagenum">030</span><a name="link030" id="link030"></a>imagine a
      better illustration, if he can, of what our Johnson's friend Pope called&mdash;in
      long meter&mdash;"fools rushing; in where angels feared to tread!" And let
      him confess to himself that these were not the times nor the men to raise
      the question.

      Is it not the fact that, until our own century, the eyes of the world were
      darkened, and men saw in these Shakespearean dramas only such stage plays,
      satisfying the acting necessities of almost any theater, as might have
      been written&mdash;not by "the soul" of any age; not by a man
      "myriad-minded" not by a "morning-star of song," or a "dear son of
      memory," but&mdash;by a clever playwright? The sort of days when an
      Addison could have been pensioned for his dreary and innocent "Campaign,"
      and a Mr. Pye made poet-laureate of the laud where an unknown pen had once
      written "Hamlet were, consequently, <i>not</i> the days for the discovery
      with which this century has crowned itself&mdash;namely, the discovery
      that the great first of poets lived in the age when England and America
      were one world by themselves, and that they must now draw together again
      to search for the master "who came"&mdash;to use, with all reverence, the
      words of Judge Holmes&mdash;"upon our earth, knowing all past, all
      present, and all future, to be leader, guide, and second gospel of
      mankind." But the fullness of time has come, and we now know that, whoever
      was the poet that he "kept," he was of quite another kidney than the
      manager of the theater, "William Shakespeare, who employed him to write
      Plays, and who wrote Revelations and Gospels instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were interested to inquire what manner of man Mr. Manager
      Shakespeare was, we have only to <span class="pagenum">031</span><a
      name="link031" id="link031"></a>look about us among the managers of
      theaters in this latter half of our nineteenth century. Let us take Mr.
      Wallack or Mr. Daly, both of whom arrange plays for the stages of their
      own theaters, for example; or, better yet, take Mr. Lion Boucieault, who
      is an actor as well as a manager, and is, moreover, as successful in his
      day as was William Shakespeare in his. Mr. Boucieault has, so far,
      produced about one hundred and thirty-seven successful plays. Mr. William
      Shakespeare produced about a hundred less. All of Mr. Boucicault's plays
      show that gentleman's skillful hand in cutting, expanding, arranging, and
      setting for the stage; and in the representation of them, Mr. Boucieault
      has himself often participated. In like manner, Mr. Shakespeare, the
      manager, we are told by tradition, often assisted at the representation of
      the dramas produced on his boards, playing the Ghost in "Hamlet," * and
      the King in "Henry VI," which indicate very readily that his place in the
      "stock" was that of a "walking (or utility) gentleman."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * And played it, it is thought by some, so wretchedly that
     he made "the gods" hoot. At any rate, in a pamphlet
     published by Lodge, in 1593, "Witt's Miserie and the World's
     Madness; Discovering the Devil's Incarnate of this age," a
     devil named "Hate-Vertue" is described as looking "as pale
     as the vizard of the ghost, which cried so miserably at the
     theatre like an oister-wife, 'Hamlet&mdash;Revenge.'" But perhaps
     Shakespeare did not play the ghost that night. Shakespeare
     also played "Old Knowell," Jonson's "Every Man in his
     Humor," "Adam," in "As You Like It," and, according to
     Jonson, apart in the latter's "Legacies," in 1603.
</pre>
    <p>
      We happen to know, also, that Mr. Shakespeare rewrote for the stage what
      his unknown poet, poets, or friends composed, from the tolerable hearsay
      testimony of his fellow <span class="pagenum">032</span><a name="link032"
      id="link032"></a>actor, Ben Jonson, who tells us that he remembers to have
      heard the players say that the stage copies of the plays were written in
      Shakespeare's autograph, and were all the more available on that account,
      because he (Shakespeare), was a good penman, in that "whatever he penned,
      he never blotted line." * Mr. Boucicault, while claiming the full credit
      to which he is entitled, is quite too clever, as well as too conscientious
      to set up for an original author or a poet, as well as a playwright.
      Neither does Shakespeare (as we have already said), anywhere appear to
      have ever claimed to be a poet, or even to have taken to himself&mdash;what
      we may, however, venture to ascribe to him&mdash;the merit of the
      stage-setting of the dramatic works, which, having been played at his
      theater, we collectively call the "Shakespearean plays" to-day. Why, then,
      to begin with, should we not conceive of Mr. Manager Shakespeare
      discharging the same duties as Mr. Wal-lack, Mr. Daly, or Mr. Boucicault?
      as very much&mdash;from the necessities of his vocation&mdash;the same
      sort of man as either of them?
    </p>

     *  Post, part III, the Jonsonian Testimony.
</pre>
    <p>
      There is scarcely any evidence either way; but the fact that the actors
      were in the habit of receiving their fair copy of these plays from the
      manager's&mdash;William Shakespeare's&mdash;own hand, seems to make it
      evident that he did not originally compose them. Indeed, if Shakespeare
      had been their author, well-to-do and bustling manager as he was, he would
      probably have intrusted their transcription to some subordinate or
      supernumerary; or, better yet, would have kept a playwright of experience
      to set his compositions for the <span class="pagenum">033</span><a
      name="link033" id="link033"></a>stage, to put in the necessary localisms,
      "gags," and allusions to catch the ear of the penny seats. Such a division
      of labor is imperative to-day, and was imperative then&mdash;or at least
      to suppose that it was not, is to suppose that of his dozen or so of
      co-managers, William Shakespeare was the one who did all the work, while
      the others looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it is surmised that Shakespeare was his own playwright; took the
      dramas and rewrote them for the actors; he inserted the requisite
      business, the exits, and entrances, and&mdash;when necessary&mdash;suited
      the reading to the actor who was to pronounce the dialogue, according as
      he happened to be fat or lean. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  It may be noted that the line, "He's fat and scant of
     breath," does not occur in the early and imperfect edition
     of "Hamlet" of 1603. Was it added to suit Burbadge? And was
     there a further change made also to suit Mr. Burbadge, the
     leading tragedian of the time? In the edition of 1603, the
     grave-digger says of Yorick's skull:

     Looke you, here's a skull hath bin here this dozen year,

     Let me see, ever since our last King Hamlet

     Slew Fortenbrasse in combat, young Hamlet's father,

     He that's mad.

     But in all subsequent editions, the grave-digger says:
     "Here's a skull now; this skull has lain i' the earth three
     and twenty years." The effect of this alteration is to add
     considerably to Hamlet's age. "Alas, poor Yorick!" he says,
     "I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most
     excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand
     times; and now how abhorred in my imagination it is! My
     gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed,
     I know not how oft," etc. How old, then, was Hamlet when
     Yorick died? But Hamlet's age is even more distinctly fixed
     by other lines which do not occur in the early edition of
     1603:

     <i>Hamlet.</i>&mdash;How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

     <i>First Clown</i>.&mdash;Of all the days of the year, I came to 't that
     day that our last King Hamlet o'ercame Fortenbras.

     <i>Hamlet.</i>&mdash;How long is that since?

     <i>First Clown.</i>&mdash;Can not tell that? Every fool can tell that;
     it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is
     mad and sent to England.

     And presently he adds: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
     thirty years.

     Mr. Marshall writes: "It would appear that Shakespeare added
     these details, which tend to prove Hamlet to have been
     thirty years old, for much the same reason as he inserted
     the line, 'He's fat and scant of breath,' namely, in order
     to render Hamlet's age and personal appearance more in
     accordance with those of the great actor, Burbadge, who
     personated him." The edition of 1603 is generally accounted
     a piratical copy of the first sketch of the play.&mdash;<i>All the
     Year Found.</i>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">034</span><a name="link034" id="link034"></a>Such
      was the employment which fell to the part of William Shakespeare, in the
      division of labor among the management in which he was a partner, and the
      resulting manuscript was what Ben Jonson's friends told him of. For
      nobody, we fancy, quite supposes that the poet, whoever he was, produced
      "Hamlet" one evening, "Macbeth" on another, and "Julius C√¶sar" on another,
      without blotting or erasing, changing, pruning or tiling a line, and then
      handed his original drafts to the players next morning to learn their
      parts from! This is not the way that poems are written (nor, we may add,
      the way theaters are managed). The greater the geniuses, the more they
      blotch and blot and dash their pens over the paper when the frenzy is in
      possession of them. And besides, the fact that there exist to-day, and
      always have existed, numerous and diverse readings of the Shakespearean
      text, does very clearly show that their author or authors did, at
      different times, vary and alter the construction of the text <span
      class="pagenum">035</span><a name="link035" id="link035"></a>as taste or
      fancy dictated, and, therefore, that the manuscripts Ben Jonson's friends
      saw and told him of (and Heminges &amp; Condell, as far as their testimony
      is of any value, confirm Jonson, for they assert that what he thought, he
      uttered with that easiness that we have received from him "scarce a blot
      in his papers", were the acting copies, and not the original manuscripts
      of the Shakespearean plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of Ben Jonson (to whose panegyric we devote a chapter
      in its place further on), the contemporaries of William Shakespeare, who
      celebrated his death in verse, nowhere assert him to have been the
      myriad-minded Oceanic (to use Coleridge's adjectives) genius which we
      conceive him now-a-days&mdash;which he <i>must</i> have been to have
      written the works now assigned to him. Let any one doubting this statement
      open the pages of Dr. Ingleby's "Shakespeare's Centurie of Prayse," a work
      claimed by its compiler to be inclusive of every allusion to, comment or
      criticism on Shakespeare, which Dr. Ingleby has been able to unearth in
      print, dating anywhere within one hundred years of Shakespeare's death. We
      have industriously turned every page of this work, and will submit to any
      other who will do the same, the question whether it contains a line which
      exhibits William Shakespeare as any other than a wit, a successful actor,
      a poet of the day, a genial and generous friend, a writer of plays, or
      whether&mdash;when eulogistic of the plays called his seven years after
      his death (a very different list, by the way, than the one assigned him
      during his life), rather than biographical as to the man, they are of any
      more value as <i>evidence</i> than Gray's or Milton's magnificent
      apostrophes to a genius with whom their <span class="pagenum">036</span><a
      name="link036" id="link036"></a>only familiarity was through report,
      rumor, or impression derived from the ever immortal works. For, like Gray,
      Coleridge, Emerson&mdash;all that John Milton knew about William
      Shakespeare was pure hearsay, derived from local report or perusal of the
      Shakespearean plays ("a book invalued," he calls them). Even if we were
      called upon to do so, we could hardly conceive Milton&mdash;a Puritan, and
      a blind Puritan at that&mdash;as much of a play-goer or boon companion of
      actors and managers. But we are not called upon to imagine any thing of
      the sort; for, as a matter of fact, John Milton was exactly seven years
      and four months old when William Shakespeare died. And so, what is called
      "the Milton testimony," upon examination, proves to be no testimony at
      all, but only hearsay&mdash;venerable, perhaps&mdash;but hearsay,
      nevertheless; * as utterly immaterial as his "Marbling his native wood
      notes wild"&mdash;a line that might be, not inaptly, applied to Robert
      Burns, but which suggests almost any thing except the stately and splendid
      pages of the Shakespearean opera&mdash;to which we have before alluded as
      justifying us, indeed, in wondering if the Puritan poet had ever gone so
      far, before formulating his opinion, as to open the book assigned to the
      Shakespeare he wrote of.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Milton was the enemy of all the ilk. "This would make them
     soon perceive what despicable creatures our common rimers
     and playwriters be," he says in his essays "of Education,"
     in 1634.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so, in the first place, there was no great call or occasion for
      discussion as to the authorship of the Shakespearean dramas in the days
      when they first began to be known by the public; and, as for Mr. Manager
      Shakespeare's friends, and the actors of his company, <span class="pagenum">037</span><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a>they testified to what they had heard,
      and, if they knew any thing to the contrary, they kept it to themselves.
      If his friends, jealous of his reputation, they were not solicitous of
      heralding him a fraud; and if the "stock" upon his pay-roll, they held
      their bread at his hand, and were not eager to offend him. If&mdash;as we
      shall notice further on&mdash;a wise few did suspect the harmless
      imposition, either they had grounds for not mentioning it, or there were
      reasons why people did not credit them. And so, in the second place, the
      times were not ripe for the truth to be known, because there was nobody
      who cared about knowing it, and nobody to whom it could be a revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To suppose that William Shakespeare wrote the plays which we call his, is
      to suppose that a miracle was vouchsafed to the race of man in London in
      the course of certain years of the reign of Elizabeth. If, however,
      instead of probing for miracles, we come to consider that men and managers
      and theaters in the age of Elizabeth were very much the same sort of
      creatures and places that we find them now; that, among the habitues of
      the Globe and Blackfriars Theaters in that reign, were certain young
      gentlemen of abundant leisure and elegant education who admitted managers
      into their acquaintance by way of exchange for the entre of the
      green-room; and that managers in those days as in these, were always on
      the alert for novelties, and drew their material&mdash;in the crude, if
      necessary, to be dressed up, or ready made, if they were so fortunate&mdash;from
      wherever they could find it; if, in short, we find that among the curled
      darlings who frequented Master William Shakespeare's side doors there was
      at least one poet, and, in their vicinity, <span class="pagenum">038</span><a
      name="link038" id="link038"></a>at least one ready writer who was so
      placed as to be eager to write anonymously for bread (and who, moreover,
      had access to the otherwise sealed and occult knowledge, philosophy, and
      reading, of which the giants of his day&mdash;to say nothing of the
      theater-managers&mdash;did not and could not dream)&mdash;if, we say, we
      consider all this, we need pin our faith to no miracles, but expect only
      the ordinary course of human events.
    </p>
    <p>
      If William Shakespeare were an unknown quantity, like Homer, to be
      estimated only by certain masterly works assigned to him, this answer
      might, indeed, be different. For, just as Homer's writings are so
      magnificent as to justify ascribing to him&mdash;so far as mere power to
      produce them goes&mdash;any other contemporary literature to be
      discovered, so the works attributed to William Shakespeare are splendid
      enough to safely credit him with the compositions of any body else; of
      even so great a man as Bacon, for example. But William Shakespeare is no
      unknown quantity&mdash;except that we lose sight of him for the few years
      between his leaving Stratford, and (as part proprietor of the largest
      London play-house) accepting Ben Jonson's play of "Every Man in His
      Humour"&mdash;we know pretty well all about him. There are half a hundred
      biographies extant&mdash;new ones being written every day&mdash;and any
      one of them may be consulted as to the manner of life William
      Shakespeare's was. The breakneck marriage bond, which waived all
      formalities, the consent of any body's parents, justification of sureties,
      three askings of banns, etc., so he could only be fast married; the
      beer-bouts, youthful and harmless enough; the poaching, enough worse, Sir
      Thomas Lucy thought, to justify instructing a War<span class="pagenum">039</span><a
      name="link039" id="link039"></a>wick attorney to prosecute the lad before
      the law: all these are matter of record, amply photographing for-us
      William Shakespeare in Stratford. Then the hiatus&mdash;and this same lad
      appears, prosperous, and in the great town; sending home money to his
      impoverished family&mdash;part proprietor of a theater, purchasing
      freehold estates in London&mdash;a grant of arms for his father&mdash;the
      great house in his native village for his own homestead; investing in the
      tithings of his county, and beginning a chancery suit to recover lands
      which his father&mdash;in his poverty&mdash;had allowed himself to forfeit
      by foreclosure. Surely we will not go far astray if we set it down that
      some pretty hard work at what this rising lad found to do in London, and
      learned to do best, has filled up those unrecorded years! Was all this
      money made by writing plays for the Globe, or by working on Bacon's Novum
      Organum, or by other literary labor? Was that the hard work William
      Shakespeare found to do, and laid up money at, in the interval between his
      last crop of wild oats at Stratford, and the condescension of the man of
      affairs in London? If it were, it is curious that no rumor or tradition of
      it comes from Stratford. Nothing travels quite so fast in rural
      neighborhoods as a reputation for "book learning," while the local worthy,
      who has actually written a book of his own, is a landmark in his vicinage.
      Now, William Shakespeare died one of the richest men&mdash;if not the
      richest&mdash;in all Stratford. It is strange that the gossip and
      goodwives, who so loaded themselves with his boyish freaks and frailties,
      should never have troubled themselves about his manly pursuits and
      accomplishments. The only English compositions he is credited within
      Stratford gossip are one <span class="pagenum">040</span><a name="link040"
      id="link040"></a>or two excessively conventional epitaphs on Elias James,
      John a Coombe, and others&mdash;the latter of which is only to be
      appreciated by a familiarity with Warwickshire patois. He sprang from a
      family so illiterate that they could not write their own name; and,
      moreover, lived and died utterly indifferent as to how anybody else wrote
      it&mdash;whether with an "x" or a "g," a "c" or a "ks." And as he found
      them, so he left them. For, although William Shakespeare enjoyed an income
      of $25,000 (present value of money) at his death, he never had his own
      children taught to read and write, and his daughter Judith signed her mark
      to her marriage bond.

      That the rustic youth, whom local traditions variously represent as a
      scapegrace, a poacher, a butcher's apprentice, and the like, but never as
      a school-boy, a student, a reader, a poet&mdash;as ever having been seen
      with a hook in his hand&mdash;driven by poverty to shift for himself,
      should at once (for the dates, as variously given by Mr. Malone and Mr.
      Grant White, are exceedingly suggestive) become the alter ego of that most
      lax, opulent, courtly, and noble young gentleman about town, Southampton,
      is almost incredible. But, it is no more incredible than that this
      ill-assorted friendship can be accounted for by the lad's superhuman
      literary talents. Southampton never was suspected, during his lifetime, of
      a devotion to literature, much less of an admiration for letters so rapt
      as to make him forget the gulf between his nobility and that of a peasant
      lad&mdash;who (even if we disbelieve his earliest biographers as to the
      holding horses and carrying links) must necessarily have been employed in
      the humblest pursuits at the outset of his London <span class="pagenum">041</span><a
      name="link041" id="link041"></a>career. But yet, according to the various
      "chronologies" (which, in the endeavor to crowd these works into William
      Shakespeare's short life, so as to tally with the dates&mdash;when known&mdash;of
      their production, only vary inconsiderably after all), the Stratford boy
      hardly puts in his appearance in London before he presents Lord
      Southampton, as the "first heir of his invention," with&mdash;if not the
      most mature&mdash;at least the most carefully polished production that
      William Shakespeare's name was ever signed to; and, moreover, as polished,
      elegant, and sumptuous a piece of rhetoric as English letters has ever
      produced down to this very day.

      Now, even if, in Stratford, the lad had mastered all the Latin and Greek
      extant; this poem, dedicated to Southampton, coming from his pen, is a
      mystery, if not a miracle. The genius of Robert Burns found its expression
      in the <i>idiom</i> of his father and his mother, in the dialect he heard
      around him, and into which he was born. When <i>he</i> came to London, and
      tried to warble in urban English, his genius dwindled into formal
      commonplace. But William Shakespeare, a peasant, born in the heart of
      Warwickshire; without schooling or practice, pours forth the purest and
      most sumptuous of English, unmixed with the faintest trace of that
      Warwickshire patois, that his neighbors and coetaneans spoke&mdash;the
      language of his own fireside! As a matter of fact, <i>English</i>, was a
      much rarer accomplishment in the days when Thomas Jenkins and Thomas Hunt
      were masters of Stratford Grammar School, than Greek and Latin. Children,
      in those days, were put at their hic, h√¶c, hoc at an age when we <span
      class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>send them to
      kindergartens. But no master dreamed of drilling them in their own
      vernacular. Admitting William Shakespeare to have been born a poet, he
      must also have been born a master of the arbitrary rules of English
      rhetoric, etymology, syntax, and prosody, as well, to have written that
      one poem. But, say the Shakespeareans, even if William did not study
      English at the Stratford Grammar School, or read it in those crowded days
      when earning his bread by menial employment in stranger London, he had an
      opportunity to study Lyly, Nash, Greene, Peele, Chettle, and the rest. But
      the Shakespearean vocabulary&mdash;like the whole canon of the plays&mdash;is
      a thing apart&mdash;unborrowed, unimitated, and unlearned from any of
      these. <i>These</i> were satisfied to write for the stages of the barns
      called "play-houses," and for their audiences, which&mdash;according to
      all reports&mdash;were decidedly indifferent as to scholarship. <i>These</i>
      might introduce a Frenchman, but they never troubled themselves to make
      him French; or a Scotchman, but they never stopped to make him Scotch. But
      even if William Shakespeare, in the immersions of the management, was
      author of that intellectual Dane, over-refined in a German university of
      metaphysics, he called Hamlet; or of that crafty Italian, named Iago; or
      of that Roman iceberg, Brutus&mdash;it is quite as difficult to conceive
      either the skylarking boy in Stratford, where there were no libraries, and
      his father too poor (not daring to stir beyond his threshold for fear of
      arrest for debt) to buy books; or the self-made man toiling from the
      bottom rung of poverty to the top of fortune&mdash;with leisure to study
      the characteristics of race and nationality&mdash;as acquiring all the
      grandeur of dic<span class="pagenum">043</span><a name="link043"
      id="link043"></a>tion, insight into the human heart (which, at least, is
      not guess-work), knowledge and philosophy, we call his to-day. Even if we
      go no further than the "Venus and Adonis"&mdash;appearing at a date
      preluding a drill that, for the sake of the argument, we might even assume&mdash;how
      could that poem have been written by the peasant who only knew his native
      dialect, or the penniless lad earning his bread in stranger London, at the
      first shift at hand&mdash;with no entre to the great libraries, and no
      leisure to use one if he had it? Ben Jonson spent some years at Cambridge
      before he was taken away and set at brickmaking&mdash;he is said to have
      been a very studious brickmaker, working, according to Fuller, with a
      trowel in one hand and a book in the other. As to his career as a soldier&mdash;a
      soldier, when not actually in the field or on the march, may find
      considerable opportunity for rumination; and, when lying in jail, he would
      certainly have ample leisure for his Greek and Roman. But Jonson wrote for
      the Elizabethan theaters; he lived and died hungry and poor, a borrower,
      over his ears in debt to the last. William Shakespeare, his contemporary,
      loaned Ben Jonson money; rose rapidly from penury to affluence; made his
      father rich, and a gentleman with an escutcheon; bought himself the most
      splendid house in Stratford (so splendid as to be deemed worthy a royal
      residence by Queen Henrietta); invested in outlying lands; speculated in
      tithes, and lived, until his death&mdash;according to Dominie Ward&mdash;at
      the rate of $25,000 a year. We are familiar enough with these stories of
      self-made men (so-called) in our daily newspapers. Let those who will,
      believe that William Shakespeare accumulated this splendid fortune, <i>not</i>
      by the success<span class="pagenum">044</span><a name="link044"
      id="link044"></a>ful management of the best appointed and affected theater
      in London, but by writing plays for its stage! and&mdash;at the same time&mdash;conceived,
      evolved from his own inner consciousness, all the learning which other
      playwrights (like Ben Jonson and the rest) were obliged&mdash;like
      ordinary mortals&mdash;to get out of books!
    </p>
    <p>
      The only efforts made to account for this wealth flowing into the coffers
      of a poet, have been mere surmises, like the story of Southampton's
      munificence, and of the royal favor of King James, who wrote the manager a
      letter with his own hand. But neither of these stories happens to be
      contemporary with William Shakespeare himself. The first was an
      afterthought of Davenant, who was ten years old when Shakespeare died; and
      who is not accepted as an authority, even as to his own pedigree, by the
      very commentators who most eagerly seize upon and swear to his Southampton
      fiction. The other is not even hearsay, but the bold invention of Bernard
      Lintot, who published an edition of the plays in 1710. Doubtless, as has
      been the ambition of all the commentators, before Mr. Collier and since,
      Lintot was bound to be at least one fact ahead of his rivals, even if he
      had to invent that fact himself, he vouchsafes, as authority for this tale
      of the royal letter, however, the statement of "a credible person now
      living," who saw the letter itself in the possession of Davenant: in the
      teeth of the certainty that, had Davenant ever possessed such a letter,
      Davenant would have taken good care that the world should never hear the
      last of it: and coyly preserves the incognito of the "credible person,"
      whom, however, Oldys conjectures must have been, if any body, the Duke of
      Buckingham. <span class="pagenum">045</span><a name="link045" id="link045"></a>But,
      miracles aside, to consider William Shakespeare as the author of the
      Shakespearean drama&mdash;for that he has christened it, and that it will
      go forever by his name, we concede&mdash;involves us in certain
      difficulties that seem altogether insurmountable. In the first place,
      scholars and thinkers, whose hearts have been open to the matchless
      message of the Shakespearean text, and who found themselves drawn to
      conclude that such a man as William Shakespeare once lived, were amazed to
      discover that the very evidence which forced them to that conclusion, also
      proved conclusively that that individual <i>could not</i> have written the
      dramas since known by his name. Coleridge, Schlegel, Goethe, Jean Paul
      Richter, Carlyle, Palmerston, Emerson, Hallam, Delia Bacon, Gervinus, and,
      doubtless, many more, clearly saw that the real Shakespeare was not the
      Shakespeare we have described. "In spite of all the biographies, 'ask your
      own hearts,' says Coleridge&mdash;'ask your own common sense to conceive
      the possibility of this man being... the anomalous, the wild, the
      irregular genius of our daily criticism. What! are we to have miracles in
      sport? or (I speak reverently) does God choose idiots by whom to convey
      divine truths to man?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there was a Shakespeare of earth, as I suspect," says Hallam&mdash;alluding
      to the fact that all the commentators told him of the man Shakespeare,
      inferred him as anything but the master he was cited&mdash;"there was also
      one of heaven, and it is of him we desire to learn more." * **

      <span class="pagenum">046</span><a name="link046" id="link046"></a>This
      evidence was of three sorts: 1. Official records and documents; 2. The
      testimony of contemporaries; and, 3. That general belief, reputation, and
      tradition, which, left to itself in the manner we have indicated, has
      grown into the presumption of nearly three hundred years. We will not
      recapitulate the well-thumbed records, nor recite the dog's-eared
      testimony, which together gave rise to the presumption. But the dilemma
      presented to the student was in this wise: By the parish records it
      appeared that a man child was christened in Stratford Church April 26th,
      (old style) 1564, by the name William. He was the son of one John
      Shakespeare, a worthy man, who lived by either, or all, the trades of
      butcher, wool-comber, or glover&mdash;three not incompatible pursuits
      variously assigned him&mdash;was, at different times, a man of some means,
      even of local importance, (becoming, on one occasion, even ale-taster for
      the town,) and, at his son's birth, owner in freehold of two plots of
      ground in Stratford village, on one of which plots a low-raftered house
      now stands, which has come to be a Mecca to which pilgrims from the whole
      world reverently repair. The next official record of the son so born to
      John Shakespeare is the marriage-bond to the Bishop of Worcester; enabling
      this son to wed one Anne Hathaway, his senior in years, which bond remains
      to this day on file in the office of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, the son, having become a person of means, purchases for his
      father a grant of arms; and (the name being Shakespeare) the heralds allot
      him an escutcheon on which is represented a shaking spear (symbolically
      treated)&mdash;a device which, under the circumstances, <span
      class="pagenum">047</span><a name="link047" id="link047"></a>did not tax
      the heralds' ingenuity, or commit them to any theory about ancestors at
      Hastings or among the Saracens. The increasing wealth of the son leaves
      its traces in the title-deeds to and records of purchase of freehold and
      leasehold possessions, of the investment in meadow-lands, and tithes, and
      of sundry law suits incidental to these. Local tradition&mdash;which in
      like cases is perforce admitted as evidence&mdash;supplements all this
      record, and, so far as it can, confirms it, until we have an all but
      complete biography.
    </p>
    <p>
      This biography the world knows by heart. It does not esteem the boy
      William Shakespeare the less because he was a boy&mdash;because&mdash;in
      the age and period reserved for that crop&mdash;he sowed and garnered his
      "wild oats." It has reason to believe him to have been much more than a
      mere wayward youth. Aubrey ("old Aubrey," "arch-gossip Aubrey," the
      Shakespeareans call him, probably because he wrote his sketch fifty years
      after his subject's death, instead of two hundred and fifty), says that he
      was the village prodigy, that "he exercised his father's trade&mdash;but,
      when he killed a calf he would do it in high style and make a speech,"
      etc., etc. Nor is there anything in the record of his mature and latter
      years&mdash;of his investments in tithes, and messuages, and homesteads&mdash;of
      his foreclosures and suits for money loaned and malt delivered&mdash;of
      his begetting children and dying; leaving&mdash;still with finical detail
      and nice and exact economy&mdash;an elaborate testament, in which he
      disposes, item by item, of each worldly thing and chattel, down to the
      second-best bedstead in his chambers, which he tenderly bestows upon the
      wife of his youth and the <span class="pagenum">048</span><a name="link048"
      id="link048"></a>mother of his children&mdash;any thing at which the world
      should sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he has done any thing worthy of posterity, he shows no especial anxiety
      that posterity shall hear of it. Besides such contracts and business
      papers as he must sign in the course of his lesseeship at the theaters,
      and in the investment of his savings, he leaves his name to nothing except
      a declaration of debt against a poor neighbor who is behind-hand with his
      account, footed at one pound fifteen shillings and sixpence, and a not
      over-creditable last Will and Testament. This is his own business, and who
      has any thing to say? But, when our biographers go a step further and
      demand that we shall accept this as the record of a demigod; of the
      creator of a "Hamlet" and an "Othello;" and this practical and thrifty
      soul, who ran away to London&mdash;worked himself up (as he must have
      worked himself up) to the proprietorship of a theater; and, in that
      business and calling earned money and kept it&mdash;as the identical man
      who singly and alone wrote the "Hamlet," the ".Julius C√¶sar," the
      "Othello," and all the splendid pages of the Shakespearean drama&mdash;some
      of us have been heard to demur! The scholar's dilemma is how to reconcile
      the internal evidence of the plays, which is spread before them undimmed
      by age, with these records, which are as authentic and beyond question as
      the internal evidence itself. And, once stated, the dilemma of the scholar
      becomes the dilemma of the whole world. Let any one try to conceive of the
      busy manager of a theater (an employment to-day&mdash;when the theater is
      at its best, and half the world play-goers&mdash;precarious for capital
      and industry; but in those days an experiment, in every <span
      class="pagenum">049</span><a name="link049" id="link049"></a>sense of the
      word), who succeeded by vigilance, exact accounting, business sagacity,
      and prudence, in securing and saving not only a competency, but a fair
      fortune; in the mean time&mdash;while engaged in this engrossment of
      business&mdash;writing Isabella's magnificent appeal to the duke's deputy,
      Angelo; or Cardinal Wolsey's last soliloquy! Or conceive of the man who
      gave the wife of his youth an old bedstead, and sued a neighbor for malt
      delivered, penning Antony's oration above C√¶sar, or the soliloquy of
      Macbeth debating the murder of Duncan, the invocation to sleep in "King
      Henry IV.," or the speech of Prospero, or the myriad sweet, or noble, or
      tender passages that nothing but a human heart could utter! Let him try to
      conceive this, we say, and his eyes will open to the absurdity of the
      belief that these lines were written by the lessee and joint-manager of a
      theater, and he will examine the evidence thereafter for corroboration,
      and not for conviction; satisfied in his own mind, at least, that no such
      phenomenon is reasonable, probable, or safe to have presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, last and greatest difficulty of all, is the Will. This is by far the
      completest and best authenticated record we have of the man William
      Shakespeare, testifying not only to his undoubtedly having lived, but to
      his character as a man; and&mdash;most important of all to our
      investigation&mdash;to his exact worldly condition. Here we have his own
      careful and ante-mortem schedule of his possessions, his chattels real and
      chattels personal, down to the oldest and most rickety bedstead under his
      roof. And we may be pretty sure that it is an accurate and exhaustive
      list. But if he <span class="pagenum">050</span><a name="link050"
      id="link050"></a>were&mdash;as well as a late theater-manager and country
      gentleman&mdash;an author and the proprietor of dramas that had been
      produced and found valuable, how about these plays? Were they not of as
      much value, to say the least, as a damaged bedstead? Were they not, as a
      matter of fact, not only invaluable, but the actual source of his wealth?
      How does he dispose of them? Does our thrifty Shakespeare forget that he
      has written them? Is it not the fact, and is it not reason and common
      sense to conceive, that, <i>not</i> having written them, they have passed
      out of his possession along with the rest of his theatrical property,
      along with the theater whose copyrights they were, and into the hands of
      others? This is the greatest difficulty and stumbling-block for the
      Shakespeareans. If their hero had written these plays, of which the age of
      Elizabeth was so fond, and in whose production he had amassed a fortune&mdash;that
      he should have left a will, in items, in which absolutely no mention or
      hint of them whatever should be made, even their most zealous pundits can
      not step over, and so are scrupulous not to allude to it at all. This
      piece of evidence is unimpeachable and conclusive as to what worldly
      goods, chattels, chattel-interests, or things in action, William
      Shakespeare supposed that he would die possessed of. Tradition is gossip.
      Records are scant and niggardly. Contemporary testimony is conflicting and
      shallow, but here, attested in due and sacred form, clothed with the
      foreshadowed solemnity of another world, is the calm, deliberate, ante
      mortem statement of the man himself. We perceive what becomes of his
      secondhand bedstead. What becomes of his plays? Is it possible that, after
      all these years' experience of their <span class="pagenum">051</span><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a>value&mdash;in the disposition of a
      fortune of which they had been the source and foundation&mdash;he should
      have forgotten their very existence?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if, diverging from the scanty records, we go to the testimony of
      contemporaries, what do we find there? Very little more of the man William
      Shakespeare, but precisely the same dilemma as to his alleged authorship
      of the plays. We find that the country lad William, the village prodigy
      with whom the gossips concerned themselves, was no milksop and no Joseph;
      that he was hail-fellow with his fellows of equal age; that he poached&mdash;shot
      his neighbors' deer; lampooned their owner when punished for the offense;
      went on drinking-bouts with his equals of the neighboring villages; and,
      finally&mdash;-just as any clever, country lad, who had made his fellows
      merry with mock eulogies over the calves he slaughtered might and probably
      would do to-day, and which is precisely what his earliest and, therefore,
      safest biographer, Howe, asserts that he did do&mdash;wound up with
      following a company of strolling players to the metropolis; where he began
      his prosperous career by holding gentlemen's horses at the theater door,
      while the gentlemen themselves went inside to witness the performance. We
      turn to the stories of the poaching, the deer-shooting, and the
      beer-drinking, with relief. It is pleasant to think that the pennywise old
      man was&mdash;at least in his youth&mdash;human. A little poaching and a
      little beer do nobody any harm, and it is, at all events, more cheerful
      reading than the record of a parsimonious freeholder taking the law of his
      poorer neighbor who defaults in the payment of a few shillings for a
      handful of malt. <span class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052"
      id="link052"></a>There is a village school in Stratford, and Mr.
      De-Quincy, and all his predecessors and successors who have preferred to
      construct pretty romances, and call them "lives of William Shakespeare,"
      rather than to accept his known and recorded youth, boldly unite in making
      their hero attend its sessions. Their assertions are bravely seconded by
      the cicerones and local guides of Stratford, who, for a sixpence, will
      show you the identical desk which Shakespeare, the lad, occupied at that
      grammar school; and at Shottery, the same guides show us the chair in
      which our hero sat while courting Mistress Anne; just as, in Wittemburg,
      these same gentry point out the house where Hamlet lived when a student in
      the University there; or, in Scotland, the spot where Fitz-James and
      Roderick Dhu fought. But, William could not have attended this school very
      perseveringly, since he turns up in London at about the age that country
      lads first go to school. In London, he seems to have risen from nothing at
      all to the position (such as it is) of co-manager, along with a dozen
      others, of a theater. Here, just as young lords and swells take theater
      managers into their acquaintance to-day, he became intimate with greater
      men than himself, and so enlarged his skirts and his patronage, as it was
      the part of a thrifty man to do. At this time there were no circulating
      libraries in London, no libraries, accessible to the general public, of
      any sort, in fact; no booksellers at every corner, no magazines or
      reviews; no public educators, and no schools or colleges swarming with
      needy students; even the literature of the age was a bound-up book to all
      except professional readers. But, for all that, this William Shakes-<span
      class="pagenum">053</span><a name="link053" id="link053"></a>peare&mdash;this
      vagrom runaway youth, who, after a term at Stratford school (admitting
      that he went where the romancers put him), cuts off to London at the heels
      of a crew of strolling players&mdash;who begins business for himself
      somewhere (perhaps as "link-boy" at a theater door, but we may be sure, at
      an humble end of some employment) and, by saving his pence, works up to be
      actually a part-proprietor in two theaters, and ultimately a rich man&mdash;begins
      to possess himself of a lore and knowledge of the Past which, even to-day,
      with all our libraries, lyceums, serials, and booksellers, it would need a
      lifetime to acquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did the work of a lifetime. Like Mr. Stewart, in New York, he began
      penniless, and by vigilance, shrewdness, and economy, rose to
      respectability, affluence, and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as we could not imagine Mr. Stewart, gentleman as he was, writing all
      the tags and labels on his goods or making with his own hand every
      pen-stroke necessary in the carrying on of his immense trade; or poems or
      philosophical essays on the manufacture of the silks and linens and
      cottons he handled while slowly coining his fortune, and revolving poetry
      in his overworked brain while overseeing the business that was evolving
      that fortune; so do we fail to conceive of William Shakespeare doing all
      the pen-work on the dramas he coins his money by producing on his boards.
      How much less can we conceive of this man composing, not only poems of his
      own, but a Literature of his own&mdash;drawing his material from the
      classic writers (and notably from those Greek plays not at that time
      translated, and only accessible in the originals and in <span
      class="pagenum">054</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>manuscript),
      from legal works, "caviare to the general;" from philosophical treatises
      not known to have been available even for reference; writing of the
      circulation of the blood in the human system&mdash;a fact not discovered
      until years after his own death! Let us find him, too, setting down, in
      writing, epitomes of all known wisdom; ascertaining the past, prophesying
      of the future; laying down off-hand the philosopher's, the lawyer's, the
      leech's, the soldier's, the scholar's craft and art, which only these
      themselves, by long years of study, might attain to&mdash;and all this
      while coining a fortune in the management of two theaters; to have solved,
      in short, the riddle of the sphinx and all the as yet unspinning
      whirligigs of time! Verily, a greater riddle than the sphinx's is this the
      riddle of the boy&mdash;Master Shakespeare. Thomas Chatterton found his
      wealth in a musty chest in an old muniment room. But here the chest and
      imminent room were not in existence till years after the boy Shakespeare
      has been a man, and traveled on to his grave. It is no solution of this
      riddle to say the lad was a genius, and that genius is that which soars,
      while education plods. *

     *  This class of evidence can not be recapitulated in the
     space of a foot note, but the curious reader will do well to
     refer to the chapter on the attainments of the author of
     Shakespeare, at pages 56-65 Holmes's "Authorship of
     Shakespeare," third edition.

      Genius itself can not account for the Shakespearean plays. Genius may
      portray, but here is a genius that not only portrayed that which after his
      death became fact, but related other facts which men had forgotten; the
      actors in which had lain in the dust for centuries, and whose records had
      slept sealed in dead languages, in manuscripts beyond his reach! Genius,
      intuition, <span class="pagenum">055</span><a name="link055" id="link055"></a>is
      beyond education indeed. It may prophesy of the future or conceive of the
      eternal; but only knowledge can draw record of the past. If the author of
      Shakespeare had been a genius only, his "Julius C√¶sar" might have been a
      masterpiece of tragedy, or pathos, or of rage; but it would have portrayed
      an ideal Rome, not the real one. His "Comedy of Errors" might have been
      matchless in humor and sparkling in contretemps, but, three years
      afterward, on translating a hidden manuscript of Plautus, the comedies
      would not have been found quite identical in argument. *

     is made to a custom obtaining among a certain undiscussable
     class of Cyprians, which it is fair to say could not be
     found mentioned in a dozen books of which we know the names
     to-day, and which, from its very nature, is treated of in no
     encyclopaedia or manual of information, or of popular
     antiquities. How could any one but an antiquarian scholar,
     in those days, have possessed himself&mdash;not in this alone,
     but in a thousand similar instances&mdash;of such minute,
     accurate, and occult information?

      The precocity of a child may be intuitive. But no babe learns its alphabet
      spontaneously or by means of its genius; but out of a book, because the
      characters are arbitrary. Pascal, when a child, discovered the eternal
      principles of geometry, and marked them out in chalk upon the floor; but
      he did not know that the curved figures he drew were called "circles," or
      that the straight ones were called "lines;" so he named them "rounds" and
      "bars." He discovered what was immutable and could be found by the
      searcher, but his genius could not reinvent arbitrary language that had
      been invented before his birth. In short, to have possessed and to have
      written down, in advance, the learning and philosophy of three centuries
      to come, <span class="pagenum">056</span><a name="link056" id="link056"></a>might
      have been the gift of Prophecy (such a gift as has ere this fallen from we
      know not where upon the sons of men) descending into the soul of a
      conceivable, genius. But who can tell of more than he knows? Second sight
      is not retrospective. And to have testified of the forgotten past, without
      access to its record, was as beyond the possibilities of genius as the
      glowing wealth of the Shakespearean page is above the creation of an
      unlettered man of business in the age of Elizabeth or of Victoria.

      Here is the dilemma with which the Shakespear-eans struggle: that in those
      years the man William Shakespeare <i>did</i> live, and was a theatrical
      manager and actor in London; and precisely the same evidence which
      convinces us that this man did live in those days, convinces the world
      to-day&mdash;or must convince it, if it will only consent to look at it&mdash;that
      the dramas we call Shakespearean were so called because they were first
      published from the stage of William Shakespeare's theaters in London, just
      as we call certain readings of the classics the "Delphin classics,"
      because brought together for a Dauphin of Prance; or certain paintings
      "D√ºsseldorf paintings," because produced in the D√ºsseldorf school. If,
      however, in the course of ages it should come to be believed that the
      Dauphin wrote the classics, or that a man named D√ºsseldorf painted the
      pictures, even then the time would come to set the world right. If there
      had been no Dauphin and no D√ºsseldorf, we might have assigned those names
      to a power which might have produced the poems or the pictures. If there
      had been no William Shakespeare, we might easily have idealized one who
      could have written the plays. But, unhap<span class="pagenum">057</span><a
      name="link057" id="link057"></a>pily, there was the actual, living,
      breathing man in possession of that name, who declines to assign it to
      another, and who is any thing but the sort of man the Shakespeareans want.
      And, moreover, once the presumption is waived and the question is opened
      again; there is a mass of evidence in the possession of this century,
      which, taken piecemeal, can be separately waived aside, but which, when
      cumulated and heaped together, is a mountain over which the airiest
      skeptic can not vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did none of William Shakespeare's contemporaries suspect the harmless
      deception? There is no proof at hand, nor any evidence at all positive,
      that the intimates of the manager understood him to be, or to have ever
      pretended to have been, the original author of the text of the plays he
      gave to his players. Let us hasten to do William Shakespeare the justice
      to say that we can find nowhere any testimony to his having asserted a
      falsehood. But, if he did so pretend to his intimates, and if the dramas
      we now call "Shakespearean" were actually produced, in those days, on
      William Shakespeare's own stage, under that pretension, certainly some of
      them must have wagged their heads in secret. Surely, Ben Johnson, who
      bears testimony that his friend Shakespeare had "small Latin and less
      Greek," must have queried a little within himself as to where certain
      things he read in the text of his friend's plays came from, always
      supposing that he did not know perfectly well where they <i>did</i> come
      from. It seems more than probable, as we have already said, that, whoever
      suspected or knew the source of the plays, and who also knew, if such was
      the fact, that they were claimed as Shakespeare's compositions <span
      class="pagenum">058</span><a name="link058" id="link058"></a>&mdash;had
      more cue to wink at than to expose the humbug. We find, indeed, that one,
      Robert Greene, by name, did protest against "an upstart crow, beautified
      with our feathers," (i. e. a borrower and adapter of other men's work,
      pretending to be a dramatist when he was not), "that, with his tygres
      heart wrapt in a player's hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out
      a blank verse as the best of you; and, beeing an absolute Johannes
      Factotum, is in his owne conceyt the only Shake-scene in a countrey." That
      is to say, in language more intelligible at this day, that, being a sort
      of Jack-of-all-trades around the theater&mdash;holding horses, taking
      tickets, acting a little, putting pieces on the stage, and writing out
      their parts for the actors&mdash;he (Shakespeare) came in time to consider
      himself a dramatist, a manager, and a tragedian, all in one. Doubtless
      Greene was inspired by jealousy&mdash;for he was a writer of plays for the
      stage himself&mdash;in making and publishing this sneer. But, as he was
      endeavoring to make his remarks so personal to Shakespeare as to be
      readily recognized, he would not have alluded to him except by some
      well-known characteristic. So he calls him a "Jack-of-all-trades," that
      is, a man who did a little of everything. Is a Jack-of-all-trades about a
      theater the ideal poet, philosopher, and seer, who wrote the Shakespearean
      drama&mdash;the ideal of the Sliakespeareans?
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the chronicles and the record, then, one William Shakespeare,
      a "general utility" actor, and <i>Johannes Factotum</i>, lived and thrived
      in London, some two hundred and fifty odd years ago. At about that date a
      book is likewise written. Who are these who find this book, and make this
      man to fit it? <span class="pagenum">059</span><a name="link059"
      id="link059"></a>Verily, there are none so blind as those who are
      determined not to see! To have written that book one must needs have been,
      let us say&mdash;for he was at least all these&mdash;a philosopher, a
      poet, a lawyer, a leech, a naturalist, a traveler, a student of Bible
      history! Strange to say, at the time this book&mdash;in portions&mdash;is
      making its appearance, there are two men living, each of whom is a poet, a
      philosopher, a student of laws and of physics, and a traveler over the
      by-ways of many lands beside his own. One of them is known to have read
      the Bible, then what we understand to-day by a "current work." Together,
      these two men possess in themselves about all of their age with which
      subsequent ages care to connect themselves. But it is not suggested that
      these two men, Bacon and Raleigh, might have written the book for which an
      author is wanted. We are to pass them by, and sift the dust at their
      illustrious feet, if haply we may find a fetich to fall down before and
      worship!
    </p>
    <p>
      Must the man that wrote the dramas have visited Italy? Mr. Halliwell and
      others inform us of Shakespeare's visit to Verona, Venice, and Florence.
      Must Shakespeare have been at the bar? My Lord Campbell writes us a book
      to show his familiarity with the science of jurisprudence. (That book has
      traveled far upon a lordly name. It is an authority until it happens to be
      read. Once we open it, it is only to find that, the passages of the
      Shakespearean dramas which stamp their author's knowledge of the common
      law are the passages his lordship does not cite, while over the slang and
      dialect which any smatterer might have memorized from turning the pages of
      an attorney's hornbook, his lordship gloats and postulates and re<span
      class="pagenum">060</span><a name="link060" id="link060"></a>lapses into
      ecstasy). Must Shakespeare have been a physician? There have not been
      wanting the books to prove him that. * And, crowning this long misrule of
      absurdity, comes an authority out of Philadelphia, to assure us that the
      youth Shakespeare, on quitting his virgin Stratford for the metropolis,
      was scrupulous to avoid the glittering temptations of London; that he
      eschewed wine and women; that he avoided the paths of vice and immorality,
      and piously kept himself at home, his only companion being the family
      Bible, which he read most ardently and vigorously! **

     We commend to readers of this paper this latest authority,
     and can not forbear noting a few of his "discoveries." Mr.
     Rees has found out (p. 37) not only that William Shakespeare
     wrote the lines&mdash;

     "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Not a hair perished,

     On their sustaining garments not a blemish,

     But fresher than before." ("The Tempest," i. 2)

     But that he took them from Deuteronomy viii. 4.

     And in Acts xxvii. 34:

     There shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.

     In which the parallelism is in the word hair!!!

     Or, again (p. 36) that the lines:

     Though they are of monstrous shape,...

     Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of Our human
     generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any ("The
     Tempest," iii. 3),

     are taken from the following:

     In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of
     the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and
     lodged us three days courteously,... who also honored us
     with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with
     such things as were necessary.&mdash;(Acts xxviii. 7-10.

     In which&mdash;unless it be in the fact that one of these
     passages is in an act and the other in Acts&mdash;the reader must
     find the parallelism for himself, without assistance from
     Mr. Rees.

     Shakespeare, Mr. Rees tells us, never neglected his Bible,
     because (p. 28) "he was indebted to one whose love added a
     bright charm to the holy passages she taught him to read and
     study&mdash;to his mother was Shakespeare indebted for early
     lessons of piety, and a reverence for a book from whose
     passages in afterlife he wove himself a mantle of undying
     fame!"

      It is to be hoped, for charity's sweet sake, that his latest authority has
      truth for his color and testimony <span class="pagenum">061</span><a

      freshness and charm of utter novelty!

      The work of Shakespeare-making goes on. The facts are of record. We may
      ran as we read them! But rather let us, out of reverence for the errors of
      our fathers, refuse to read at all, and accept the ideal of Malone, of
      Halliwell and De Quincy, of Grant White, and of ten thousand more, who
      prefer to write their biographies of William Shakespeare, not in the first
      person, like Baron Munchhausen, nor in the second person, like the memoirs
      of Sully, but in the probable and supposititious person of "it is possible
      he did <i>this</i>," and "it is likely he did <i>that.</i>"

      Let those who will, disparage the boy and man William Shakespeare, who
      married and made an honest woman of Anne Hathaway of Shottery; left home
      to earn his own living rather than be a drain on the slender household
      store; used his first wealth to make a gentleman of his father; and who,
      with what followed, purchased himself a home on his boyhood's <span

      UT, having taken the liberty of doubting whether&mdash;as matter of record&mdash;one
      William Shakespeare, of Stratford town, in England, sometime
      part-proprietor of the Globe and Blackfriars Theaters in London, could
      have very well been himself and the author of what are known popularly
      to-day as "the plays of Shakespeare," although there seemed to be ground
      for supposing that he might have cast them into something of the acting
      form they possess as preserved to us; and having come to the conclusion
      that&mdash;once this presumption is lifted&mdash;all the evidence
      procurable as to the life and times of the actual William Shakespeare is
      actually evidence cumulative to the truth of the proposition as to the
      record: let us proceed to inquire whether&mdash;on review&mdash;a case
      rested on this evidence can be rebutted by those certain considerations
      and matters, by way of rejoinder, which are stereotype and safe to come to
      the surface whenever these waters are troubled&mdash;which whoever
      ventures to canvass the possibilities of an extra Shakesperean authorship
      of the dramas can so infallibly anticipate.

     As no English translation has been made of the Orlando
     Innamorato, I must ask the reader who can not command the
     original to be content with this rendering of the above
     stanza:

     "The man who steals a horn, a horse, a ring,

     Or such a trifle, thieves with moderation,

      the mere rudiments of learning;" admit that "his devotion to his family
      drove him forth from the rural seclusion of Stratford into the battle of
      the great world;" that the immortal gift of the second-best bed was, (we
      quote from Mr. Grant White, who is apparently willing to sacrifice
      anybody's reputation if he can thereby prove his William to have been a
      prodigy of virtue no less than of genius), explained by the fact that, at
      the time of the hurried marriage, a husband had to be provided for
      Mistress Hathaway without loss of time, and that little Susannah was as
      much of a surprise to William as to any body&mdash;in other words, that
      Anne was "no better than she should be," (oblivious of the fact that "the
      premature Susannah" was William Shakespeare's favorite child; that he, at
      least, never doubted her paternity, for he left her the bulk of his
      fortune in his will);or even that&mdash;according to Steevens, that
      testamentary second thought was actually "a mark of rare confidence and
      devotion;" granted all these&mdash;if they have anything to do with the
      question&mdash;and a dozen more, and we only attenuate, by the exact value
      of these, <span class="pagenum">066</span><a name="link066" id="link066"></a>the
      mountain of probability, nothing less than the complete dilapidation and
      disappearance of which could leave room for substitution, In the stead of
      the probability, the <i>possibility</i> of such a suspension of the laws
      of nature as is required by the Shakespearean theorists. For, as we have
      said, the evidence is cumulative, and, therefore, no more to be waived or
      disposed of by doubts as to, or even the dispelment of, this or that or
      the other item&mdash;or disintegration of this or that or the other block&mdash;of
      evidence than the Coliseum has been wiped away and disposed of because its
      coping has crumbled, or because, for some centuries, the petty Roman
      princes built their palaces from its debris.

    <p>
      And we may as well remark that, just here, it is always in order to
      mention Archbishop Whately's "Historic Doubts." We wish some of the
      gentlemen who cite it so glibly, would take the trouble to read that
      clever little book. It is a logical, not a whimsical effort. It was
      intended by its author as an answer to "Hume's Essay on Miracles." Hume's
      argument being, in the opinion of the Archbishop, reducible to the
      proposition that miracles were impossible because they were improbable,
      his lordship wrote his little work to show that the history of Napoleon
      was actually most improbable, and, written of feigned characters, would
      read like the most extravagant fable. Surely it can not be necessary to
      reiterate the difference between the Archbishop's brochure and the
      proposition of "The Shakspearean Myth!" The one was the argument from
      improbability, applied to facts in order to show its dangerous and
      altogether vicious character. The other is the demonstration <span
      class="pagenum">067</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>that history&mdash;that
      the record&mdash;when consulted, is directly fatal to a popular
      impression, and directly contradictory of a presumption, born of mere
      carelessness and accident, and allowed to gather weight by mere years and
      lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for the sake of the argument, let us leave the discussion, for the
      moment, just where it stands, and take still bolder ground. Instead of
      sifting evidence and counting witnesses, let us assume that, when we
      painted William Shakspeare&mdash;who lived between the years 1564 and 1616&mdash;as
      an easy-going rural wag, with a rural wit, thereafter to be sharpened by
      catering to the "gods" of a city theater; a poacher on occasion, and
      scapegrace generally in his youth, who chose the life of "a vagabond by
      statute"&mdash;i. e. a strolling player&mdash;but who turned up in London,
      and found his way into more profitable connection with a permanent
      play-house; and, in his advancing years, became thrifty, finally sordid&mdash;we
      had only taken the liberty of conceiving, like every other who ever wrote
      on a Shakespearean theme, yet one more William Shakespeare; so that,
      instead of ten thousand William Shakespeares, no two of which were
      identical, there were now ten thousand and one! Admitting <i>that,</i> the
      next question would of necessity be&mdash;and such an investigation as the
      present must become utterly valueless if prosecuted with bias or with
      substitution of personal opinion for historical fact&mdash;whose William
      Shakespeare is probably most a likeness of the true William Shakespeare,
      who <i>did</i> wander from Stratford to London, who <i>did</i> sojourn
      there, and who <i>did</i> wander back <span class="pagenum">068</span><a
      name="link068" id="link068"></a>again to Stratford, and there was gathered
      to his fathers, in the year 1616?
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular William Shakespeare, built to fit the plays, is a masterless
      philosopher, a matchless poet, a student of Greek manuscripts and classic
      manners, of southern romance and northern sagas, a traveler and a citizen
      of the world, a scientist, a moralist, a master of statecraft, and skilled
      in all the graces and amenities of courtly society! Which of these two
      portraits is nearest to the life? Let us take an appeal to History.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appears to be but one way to go about to discover; that way is to
      appeal to the truth of history; to go as nearly back as we can get to the
      lifetime of the actual man we are after, and inquire, wherever a trace of
      him can be touched, what manner of man he was. How, it happens that the
      very nearest we can come to an eye-witness as to the personnel of William
      Shakespeare is the Reverend John Ward, Vicar of Stratford, who wrote in
      that town a diary or memoranda, between February, 1662, and April, 1663,
      say forty-seven years after William Shakespeare's death. The following
      meager references to his late fellow-townsman are all (except an entry to
      the effect that he had two daughters, etc.; and another memorandum,
      "Remember to peruse Shakespeare's plays, etc.,) thought worth while by
      Dominie Ward, viz:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard that Mr. Shakespeare was a natural wit, without any art at
      all; he frequented the plays all his younger time, but in his elder days
      he lived at Stratford, and supplied the stage with two plays every year,
      and for that he had an allowance so large that <span class="pagenum">069</span><a
      name="link069" id="link069"></a>he spent at the rate of ¬£1,000 a year, as
      I have heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merrie meeting, and, it seems,
      drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a feaver there contracted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, chronologically, we come to a gentleman named Aubrey. This Mr.
      Aubrey was himself a native of Warwickshire; was born in 1627&mdash;that
      is, eleven years after Shakespeare died. He entered gentleman commoner of
      Trinity College, Oxford, and so, presumably, was no Puritan. He was
      considerable of a scholar himself, and was esteemed, we are told, a Latin
      poet of no mean abilities, he was admitted a barrister of the Inner Temple
      in 1646; and so, a scholar, a poet, and a lawyer, might presumably know
      the difference between a wag and a genius. His manuscripts are preserved
      in the Ashmolean Museum. He gives an account of his fellow-countyman, and,
      coming as it does, next to Dominie Ward's, nearer to the lifetime of
      William Shakespeare than any chronicle extant, (Malone admits it was not
      written later than 1680), we give it entire:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-upon-Avon, in the county of
      Warwick. His father was a butcher, and I have been told heretofore by some
      of his neighbours that, when he was a boy, he exercised his father's
      trade; but when he killed a calfe he would doe it in a high style, and
      make a speech. There was, at this time, another butcher's son in that
      towne, that was held not at all inferior to him for a natural witt, his
      acquaintance and coetanean, but died young. This Wm. being inclined
      naturally to poetry and acting, came to London, I guess about eighteen,
      <span class="pagenum">070</span><a name="link070" id="link070"></a>and was
      an actor at one of the play-houses, and did act exceedingly well. (Now B.
      Jonson never was a good actor, but an excellent instructor.) He began
      early to make essays at dramatic poetry, which at that time was very lowe,
      and his plays took well. He was a handsome, well-shaped man, very good
      company, and of a verie redie and pleasant smooth witt. The humour of the
      Constable in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' he happened to take at Gremlon,
      in Bucks, * which is the road from London to Stratford, and there was
      living that Constable, about 1642, when I first came to Oxon. Mr. Jos.
      Howe is of that parish, and knew him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Aubrey says, in a note at this place: "I think it was a
     midsummer's night that he happened there. But there is no
     Constable in 'Midsummer Night's Dream.'" Aubrey probably
     intended reference to Dogberry, in the "Much Ado."
</pre>
    <p>
      Ben Jonson and he did gather humours of men dayly, wherever they came. One
      time, as he was at Stratford-upon-Avon, one Combes, an old rich usurer,
      was to be buryed; he makes there this extemporary epitaph:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ten in the hundred the Devil allows,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Combes will have twelve, he swears and vows.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If any one asks who lies in this tomb,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Hoh," quoth the Devil, "'tis my John a Combe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wont to go to his native country once a year. I think I have been
      told that he left ¬£200 or ¬£300 a year, or thereabouts, to a sister. I have
      heard Sir William Davenant and Mr. Thomas Shadwell (who is counted the
      best comedian we have now) say that he had a most prodigious witt, and did
      admire his natural parts beyond all other dramaticall writers. He was
      <span class="pagenum">071</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>wont to
      say that he never blotted out a line in his life; says Ben Jonson, 'I wish
      he had blotted out a thousand.' His comedies will remain witt as long as
      the English tongue is understood, for that he handles <i>mores hominum</i>:
      How our present writers reflect much upon particular persons and
      coxcombites that twenty years hence they will not be understood. Though,
      as Ben Jonson says of him, that he had but little Latin and less Greek, he
      understood Latin pretty well, for he had been, in his younger days, a
      school-master in the country." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Aubrey's MSS. was called "Minutes of Lives," and was
     addressed to his "worthy friend Mr. Anthony Wood, Antiquary
     of Oxford." A letter to Wood, dated June 15, 1680,
     accompanied it, in which Aubrey says: "'T is a task that I
     never thought to have undertaken till you imposed it upon
     me, saying that I was fit for it by reason of my general
     acquaintance, having now not only lived above half a century
     of years in the world, but have also been much tumbled up
     and down in it, which hath made me so well known. Besides
     the modern advantage of coffee-houses, before which men knew
     not how to be acquainted but with their own relations or
     societies, I might add that I come of a long-aevious race,
     by which means I have wiped some feathers off the wings of
     time for several generations, which does reach high."
</pre>
    <p>
      Imagine this as the record of a real "Shakespeare!" Could we imagine it as
      the record of a Milton? Let us conceive of a fellow-countryman of John
      Milton's, a college-bred man and a Latin poet, saying of the author of
      "Paradise Lost;" "He was a goodish-looking sort of man, wore his hair
      long, was a clerk, or secretary, or something to Cromwell, or some of his
      gang; had some trouble with his wife; was blind, as I have heard; or,
      perhaps, it was deaf he was." And conceive of this, a few years after
      Milton's death being <span class="pagenum">072</span><a name="link072"
      id="link072"></a>actually all the information accessible concerning him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But to continue our search in the vicinage. On the 10th day of April, 1693
      (thirteen years later), a visitor to Warwickshire wrote a letter to his
      cousin, describing, among other points of interest, the village and church
      of Stratford-upon-Avon. And, as the letter was discovered among the papers
      of a well-known nobleman, addressed to a person known to have lived, and
      indorsed by this latter, "From Mr. Dowdall; description of several places
      in Warwickshire"&mdash;as it bears on its face evidence of its
      genuineness, and, above all, mentions William Shakespeare, precisely in
      the same strain that it alludes to other worthies of the county&mdash;the
      Beauchamps, the Nevilles, etc.&mdash;it has always been accepted as
      authentic. After a description of the tomb and resting place of "our
      English tragedian, Mr. Shakespeare," the writer continues:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The clerk that showed me this church was above eighty years old. * He
      says that this Shakespeare was formerly of this town, bound apprentice to
      a butcher; but that he ran from his master to London, and there <span
      class="pagenum">073</span><a name="link073" id="link073"></a>was received
      into the play-house as a servitour, and by this means had an opportunity
      to be what he afterwards proved. He was the best of his family, but the
      male line is extinguished. Not one, for fear of the curse abovesaid, dare
      touch his gravestone, though his wife and daughters did earnestly desire
      to be laid in the same grave with him."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I.e. (more than "above" three years old when she died.)
     This letter was among the papers of Lord DeClifford, which
     were sold by auction&mdash;and was purchased by Mr. Rodd, a well-
     known antiquarian bookseller, of Great Newport Street,
     London, in 1834. Mr. Rodd printed it in pamphlet form in
     1838 (at least the copy we have bears imprint of that year).
     It is dated "Butler's Merston in Warwickshire, April, the
     10th, 1693;" is signed, "Your very faithful kinsman and most
     aff'te humble serv't till death, John at Stiles," and is
     addressed, "These for Mr. Southwell, pr. serv't." This is
     Mr. Edward Southwell, and the letter is indorsed in his
     handwriting, "From Mr. Dowdall. Description of several
     places in Warwickshire." Mr. Rodd says that the writer was
     "an Inns'-of-Court-Man."

      Next, chronologically, comes the contribution preserved to us by a
      Reverend Richard Davies, Rector of Sapperton, * in Gloucestershire. The
      Reverend William Fulman, who died in 1688, bequeathed certain of his
      biographical collections to this Reverend Davies. Davies died in 1708,
      leaving many annotations to his friend's manuscripts. Among these
      annotations he writes the following of William Shakespeare: "William
      Shakespeare was born at Stratford upon Avon, in Warwickshire, about
      1563-4, much given to all unluckiness in stealing venison and rabbits,
      particularly from Sir Lucy, who had him oft whipt, and some times
      imprisoned, and at last made him fly his native country to his great
      advancement. But his revenge was so great that he is his 'Justice
      Clodpate' ** and calls him a great man, and that, in allusion to his name,
      bore three lowses rampant for his arms. From an actor he became a
      composer. He died April 23, 1616, aetat fifty-three, probably at Stratford&mdash;for
      there he is buried, and hath a monument (Dugd.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  His MS. additions to the MSS. of the Rev. William Fulman
     (in which the allusion to Shakespeare is made) are all in
     the library of Corpus Christ! College, Oxford.

     **  Probably a reference to Justice Shallow, in "Merry Wives
     of Windsor." p. 520.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">074</span><a name="link074" id="link074"></a>on
      which he lays a heavy curse upon any one who shall remove his bones. He
      died a papist. Whatever these may be worth&mdash;for, of course, like the
      rest, they are mere second-hand and hearsay&mdash;it is fair to include
      them in a collection of what the law calls "general reputation," "general
      report," or "common fame," and it is fair to offset this collection, at
      least, against that "common fame" and "common reputation" which has grown
      up during the last hundred years or so concerning William Shakespeare,
      which is so unboundedly to his glory and renown. Much later along, we are
      made acquainted, too, with a tradition, related by one John Jordan, a
      townsman of Stratford, (who was known in the days of Malone and the
      Ireland forgeries as "the Stratford poet,") who claimed to have succeeded
      in the line of descent to a tradition of an alleged drinking-bout of
      Shakespeare and others (as representing Stratford) against the champions
      of Pebworth, Marston, Hillborough, Grafton, Wixford, Broom, and Bidford,
      in which William was so worsted that his legs refused to carry him farther
      homeward than a certain thorn-tree, thereafter to come in for its share of
      worshipful adoration from the Shakespearean sticklers. But the tradition
      is of no value except as additional testimony to the impression of his
      boon companions, associates, and contemporaries, that William Shakespeare
      was a jolly dog who loved his frolic, his pot of ale, and his wench&mdash;was
      almost any thing, in short, except the student of history, antiquity, and
      classic manners, no less than the scholar of his own times, that he has
      been created since by those who knew him not. Nothing travels faster in
      rural communities, as we <span class="pagenum">075</span><a name="link075"
      id="link075"></a>have remarked, than a reputation for "book-learning;" let
      us continue our search for Shakespeare's.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an interest in the Shakespearean drama began to assert itself, and
      people began to inquire who wrote it, not a step could they get beyond the
      Rev. John Ward, Richard Davies, and Aubrey. At the outset they ran full
      against this village "ne'er-do-weel" and rustic wag, who worked down into
      a man of thrift, made money off his theatrical shares and properties in
      London, and spent it royally in Stratford, drinking himself into his grave
      some seven years before the first collection of what the world in time was
      to credit him with, (but improved and enlarged beyond what it ever was in
      his day) the Shakes-perean drama&mdash;first saw the light. Perhaps
      Dominie Ward may have been dazzled by the open house of the richest man in
      town. A thousand pounds a year is an income very rarely enjoyed by poets,
      and, we think, more easily accounted for by interests in tithes and
      outlying lands in Stratford, than by the "two plays a year," in and about
      the days when from four to eight pounds was the price of an acting play
      (according to Philip Henslow, a sort of stage pawnbroker and padrone of
      those days, who kept many actors in his pay, and whose diary or cash book,
      in which he entered his disbursements and receipts, is still extant), and
      twenty pounds a sum commanded only by masters. The prodigality which dazed
      the simple Stratford dominie was easily paid for, no doubt, by something
      less than the income named; and such an income, too, would tally with
      William Shakespeare's own estimate of his worldly goods in his Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the statement is the nearest and best evidence <span class="pagenum">076</span><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a>we have at hand, and so let it he
      accepted. And so, running up against this William Shakespeare, these
      commentators were obliged to stop. But there were the dramas, and there
      was the name "William Shakespeare" tacked to them; it was William
      Shakespeare they were searching for; and, since the William Shakespeare
      they had found, was evidently not the one they wanted, they straightway
      began to construct one more suitable. The marvelous silence of history and
      local tradition only stimulated them, They must either confess that there
      was no such man, or make one; they preferred to make one.
    </p>
    <p>
      First (for Rowe has only&mdash;in his eight honest pages of biographical
      notice&mdash;narrated certain gossip or facts, on the authority, perhaps,
      of Betterton, and does not claim to be an explorer, and Heminges and
      Condell, who edited the first folio, made no biographical allusion
      whatever) came Edmund Malone. With the nicest and most painstaking care he
      sifted every morsel and grain of testimony, overturned histories,
      chronicles, itineraries, local tradition, and report&mdash;but in vain.
      The nearer he came to the Stratford "Shaughraun," the further away he got
      from a matchless poet and an all-mastering student. But, like those that
      were to come after him, instead of accepting the situation, and confessing
      the William Shakespeare who lived at Stratford not mentionable in the same
      breath with the producer of the august text which had inspired his search,
      he preferred to rail and marvel at the stupidity of the neighborhood, and
      the sins of the chroniclers who could so overlook prodigies. Far from
      concluding that&mdash;because he finds no such name as William Shakespeare
      in the national Walhalla&mdash;<span class="pagenum">077</span><a
      name="link077" id="link077"></a>therefore no such name belonged there, he
      assumes, rather, that the Walhalla builders do not understand their
      business. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That almost a century should have elapsed from the time of his [William
      Shakespeare's] death, without a single attempt having been made to
      discover any circumstance which could throw a light on the history of his
      life or literary career,... are circumstances which can not be
      contemplated without astonishment. *... Sir William Dugdale, born in 1605,
      and educated at the school of Coventry, twenty miles from
      Stratford-upon-Avon, and whose work, 'The Antiquities of Warwickshire,'
      appeared in 1646, only thirty years after the death of our poet, we might
      have expected to give some curious memorials of his illustrious
      countryman. But he has not given us a single particular of his private
      life, contenting himself with a very slight mention of him in his account
      of the church and tombs of Stratford-upon-Avon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      The next biographical printed notice that I have found is in Fuller's
      'Worthies,' folio, 1662; in 'Warwickshire,' page 116&mdash;where there is
      a short account of our poet, furnishing very little information concerning
      him. And again, neither Winstanley, in his 'Lives of the Poets,' 8vo,
      1687; Langbaine in 1691; Blount in 1694; Gibbon in 1699&mdash;add anything
      to the meager accounts of Bug-dale and Fuller. That Anthony Wood, who was
      himself a native of Oxford, and was born but fourteen years after the
      death of our author, should not <span class="pagenum">078</span><a
      name="link078" id="link078"></a>have collected any anecdotes of
      Shakespeare, has always appeared to me extraordinary. Though Shakespeare
      has no direct title to a place in the 'Athen√¶ Oxoniensis,' that diligent
      antiquary could easily have found a niche for his life as he has done for
      many others not bred at Oxford. The Life of Davenant afforded him a very
      fair opportunity for such an insertion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty was, that Mr. Malone was searching among the poets for one
      by the name of William Shakespeare, when there was no such name among the
      poets; he found him not, because he was not there. He might with as much
      propriety have searched for the name of Grimaldi in the Poets' Corner, or
      for Homer's on the books of the Worshipful Society of Patten-makers. To be
      sure, in writing up Stratford Church, Sir William Dugdale can not very
      well omit mention of the tomb of Shakespeare, any more than a writer who
      should set out to make a guide-book of Westminster Abbey could omit
      description of the magnificent tomb of John Smith. But in neither the case
      of Dugdale nor in that of the cicerone of the Abbey is the merit of the
      tomb a warrant for the immortality of the entombed. It is, possibly, worth
      our while to pause just here, and contemplate the anomaly the
      Shakespeareans would have us accept&mdash;would have us to swallow, or
      rather bolt, with our eyes shut&mdash;namely, the spectacle (to mix the
      metaphor) of the mightiest genius the world has ever borne upon its
      surface, living utterly unappreciated and unsuspected, going in and out
      among his fellows in a crowded city of some two hundred thousand
      inhabitants, among whom were <span class="pagenum">079</span><a
      name="link079" id="link079"></a>certain master spirits whose history we
      have intact to-day, and whose record we can possess ourselves of with no
      difficulty&mdash;without making any impression on them, or imprint on the
      chronicles of the time, except as a clever fellow, a fair actor (with a
      knack, besides, at a little of every thing), so that in a dozen years he
      is forgotten as if he had never been; and&mdash;except that a tourist,
      stumbling upon a village church, finds his name on a stone&mdash;passed
      beyond the memory of a man in less than the years of a babe! The blind old
      Homer at least was known as a poet where he was known at all; the seven
      cities which competed for the tradition of his birth when criticism
      revealed the merit of his song&mdash;though he might have begged his bread
      in their streets&mdash;at least did not take him for a tinker! It is not
      that the Shakespearean dramas were not recognized as immortal by the
      generation of their composer that is the miracle; neither were the songs
      of Homer. Perhaps, so far as experience goes, this is rather the rule than
      the exception. The miracle is, that in all the world of London and of
      England nobody knew that there <i>was</i> any Shakespeare, in the very
      days when the Drama we hold so priceless now was being publicly rendered
      in a play-house, and printed&mdash;as we shall come to consider further on&mdash;for
      the benefit of non-theater-goers!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it is said, the great fire of London intervened and burned up all the
      records&mdash;that is how we happen to have no records of the immortal
      Shakespeare. Then, again, there is the lapse of time&mdash;the ordinary
      wear and tear of centuries, and the physical changes of the commercial
      center of the world. But how <span class="pagenum">080</span><a
      name="link080" id="link080"></a>about Edmund Spenser? That we have his
      poetry and the record of his life, is certain. Or, how about Chaucer? Did
      the great fire of London affect his chronicle and his labors? The records
      of Horace, and Maro, of Lucretius, of Juvenal, and Terence, had more than
      a great fire of London to contend with. But they have survived the ruin of
      empires and the crash of thrones, the conflagrations of libraries and the
      scraping of palimpsests. And yet the majesty and might of the
      Shakespearean page, how greater than Horatius or Maro, than Juvenal and
      Terence! If it all were a riddle, we could not read it. But it is not a
      riddle. It is the simplest of facts&mdash;the simple fact that the
      compilers of the Shakespearean pages worked anonymously, and concealed
      their identity so successfully that it lay hidden for three hundred years,
      and defies even the critical acumen, the learning and the research of this
      nineteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Edmund Malone. He is not deterred by his failure to find
      a poet of the name of Shakespeare. Determined that a poet of that name
      there shall be, and not being at hand, he proceeds&mdash;and he has the
      credit of being the first to undertake the task&mdash;to construct an
      immortal bard. And a very pretty sort of fellow he turns out, too!&mdash;one
      that, with such minor variations as have, from time to time, suggested
      themselves to gentlemen of a speculative turn of mind, has been a standard
      immortal William all along. For they who seek will find. Had Mr. Malone
      searched for the Stratford "shaughraun," who ran off and became an actor
      (as capably respectable a profession as any other, for the man makes the
      profession, and not the profession the man); who revis<span class="pagenum">081</span><a
      name="link081" id="link081"></a>ited his native haunts&mdash;on the
      lookout, not for king's and cardinals, not for dukes and thanes and
      princes&mdash;but for clowns and drunkards and misers to dovetail in among
      the Hamlets and Othellos that passed under his adapting pen; * had he
      searched for the <span class="pagenum">082</span><a name="link082"
      id="link082"></a>Stratford' butcher's son, who was the Stratford wag as
      well, and who never slaughtered a sheep without making a speech to his
      admiring fellow-villagers, here he was at his hand.

     * It is as curious as suggestive to find that the prologue
     and choruses of the "Henry V." and "Henry VIII." are
     apologies for the imperfections of the plots, and the folly
     of the multitude they catered to. As to the internal
     testimony of the authorship of these compositions, any
     reader can judge for himself. We have expressed our own
     opinion as being that William Shakespeare might be credited
     with the characters of Nym and Bar-dolph; especially of the
     Corporal, whose part consists of the phrase, "There's the
     humor of it," intruded at each convenient interval; and it
     is possible that Shakespeare, in fitting up the matter in
     hand, interpolated this as the reigning by-word of the
     moment. There seems to be reason for believing that this
     expression did happen to be a favorite at about that time;
     and that Shakespeare was not the only one who rang the
     changes on it as a season to stage material. Witness the
     following:

     Cob. Nay, I have my rheum, and I can be angry as well as
     another, sir!

     Cash. Thy rheum, Cob? Thy humor, thy humor! Thou mistak'st.

     Cob. Humor? Mack, I think it be so indeed! What is that
     humor? Some rare thing, I warrant.

     Cash. Marry, I tell thee, Cob, it is a gentlemanlike
     monster, bred in the special gallantry of our time by
     affectation, and fed by folly.

     Cob. How must it be fed?

     Cash. Oh, aye; humor is nothing if it be not fed. Didst thou
     never hear that? It's a common phrase, "Feed thy humor."

     Every Man in his Humor, iii. 4.

     Couldst thou not but arrive most acceptable Chiefly to such
     as had the happiness Daily to see how the poor innocent word
     Was racked and tortured.

     Every Man Out of his Humor.

     "Humor" was, it would seem by this, the over-used and abused
     word of these times; just as for example "awful" might be
     said to be an over-used and abused word during our own
     times.

     **  Ibid. A curious instance of this familiarity&mdash;to be
     found in the Shakespearean dramas&mdash;with the least noticed
     facts of science, and which, so far as we know, has escaped
     the critics, we might allude to here: In one of Jules
     Verne's realistic stories wherein he springs his romantic
     catastrophes upon scientific phenomena&mdash;"Michael Strogoff"&mdash;
     he makes Michael fall among enemies who sentence him to be
     blinded. The blinding is to be accomplished with a heated
     iron, but Michael sees his mother at his side, and, tears
     suffusing his eyes, the heat of the iron is neutralized, and
     fails to destroy the sight. So, in "King John," Act IV.,
     Scene 1, Arthur says to Hubert:

     The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,

     Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears And quench
     his fiery indignation.

     This may be mere coincidence, but the dramas are crowded
     with such coincidences, and for that, if for that only, are
     marvelous. In either case, according to the Shakespereans,
     we have only to go on, for the rest of time, in discovering
     new truths in nature and facts in science, only to find that
     the Stratford butcher's boy knew all about them three
     hundred years ago&mdash;was familiar with all that we have yet to
     learn, and that to his unlettered genius our wisdom was to

      Most wonderful of all, this utter ignoring of William Shakespeare among
      the poets, if unjust, provoked no remonstrance from the immediate family
      or any kin of the Stratford lad. Either the Shakespeares, Ardens, and
      Hathaways were wonderfully destitute of family pride, or else the
      obscurity accorded their connection was perfectly just and proper. No
      voice of kin or affinity of William Shakespeare (at least we may say this
      with confidence) ever claimed immortality for him; although it can not be
      said that they had no opportunity, had they wished to do so, for William
      Shakespeare's granddaughter, Lady Barnard, was alive until 1670; his
      sister, Joan Hart, till 1646; and his daughters, Susannah Hall and Judith
      Queeny, until 1662. So that Dugdale, at least, if not Wood and the rest of
      them, would not have had to go far to confirm any rumors they might have
      stumbled upon as to the <span class="pagenum">084</span><a name="link084"
      id="link084"></a>acquirements and accomplishments of the man Shakespeare;
      but it seems that not even the partiality of his own kin, nor family fame,
      nor pride of ancestry, ever conceived the idea of palming off their
      progenitor upon futurity as a giant of any build. If there is any
      exception to this statement, it would appear to be as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      I. It is recorded by Oldys that, one of his (Shakespeare's) "younger
      brothers, who lived to a great age, when questioned, in his last days,
      about William, said he could remember nothing of his performance but
      seeing him 'act a part in one of his own comedies, wherein, being to
      personate a decrepit old man, he wore a long beard, and appeared so weak
      and drooping and unable to walk, that he was forced to be supported and
      carried to a table at which he was seated among some company, and one of
      them sang a song.'" Mr. Fullom has demonstrated from the Shakespeare
      family records, that Oldys must have been mistaken as to any brother of
      William Shakespeare's having furnished this reminiscence; but, admitting
      it as the statement of a surviving brother, it stands for what it is, and
      it certainly is not the record or tradition of one whose popular memory in
      men's minds was that of an immortal prodigy. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We take this quotation from Mr. Grant White's article on
     Shakespeare in Appleton's "American Cyclopoedia." Mr.
     White's admirable contributions to our Shakespearean
     literature entitle his opinion to great weight in any mooted
     question as to William Shakespeare; and we must confess
     that, in some portions, his paper we have just mentioned
     almost suggests him as agreeing with us as to his subject.
     Mr. White says, in another place: "Young lawyers and poets
     produced plays rapidly. Each theatrical company not only
     'kept a poet,' but had three or four, in its pay. At the
     time of his leaving Stratford the drama was rising rapidly
     in favor with all classes in London, where actors were made
     much of in a certain way. And where there was a constant
     demand for new plays, ill-provided younger sons of the
     gentry, and others who had been bred at the universities and
     the inns-of-court, sought to mend their fortunes by
     supplying this demand." And again: "We are tolerably well
     informed by contemporary writers as to the performances of
     the eminent actors of that time, but of Shakespeare's we
     read nothing." Mr. White admits, a few lines below the
     sentence just quoted, that Shakespeare's position in the
     stock at the Blackfriars was "general utility." We should
     rather call it, from the evidence, "first old man."
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">085</span><a name="link085" id="link085"></a>II. An
      epitaph was placed over the remains of Susannah Hall, presumably by one of
      the family, which read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Witty above her sex, but that's not all:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wise to salvation was good Mistress Hall.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Something of Shakespeare was in that, but this
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wholly of him with whom she's now in bliss."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the writer of this mortuary eulogy meant that either William
      Shakespeare or Mistress Hall, or both, were "witty above their sex" or
      "wise to salvation," cannot, at this date, be determined: but it would
      seem that this is all the immediate family of William Shakespeare have
      ever contributed to our knowledge of him, and that their estimate of him
      was not unlike that of his chroniclers and contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Malone&mdash;and, being the first investigator, he would,
      doubtless, have been followed, as he has been, whatever the result of his
      inquiries&mdash;Mr. Malone, in spite of the silence of the authorities to
      whose <span class="pagenum">086</span><a name="link086" id="link086"></a>pages
      he had recourse, not only assumed all he could not find authority for, but
      undertook to tell us the precise dates at which his Stratford lad composed
      the plays themselves. Among other achievements he constructed an admirable
      "chronology" of the Shakespearean plays; which&mdash;with such fanciful
      variations as have been made to it from time to time since&mdash;is an
      authority with the Sliakespeareans even to this day. To be sure, Mr.
      Malone did not rely entirely upon external evidence for this apochrypha.
      He often appeals to the text, as when, for example, he settles the date at
      which the "Merchant of Venice" was composed&mdash;as 1594, because Portia
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Even as a flourish when true subjects bow
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To a new crowned monarch,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      referring of course, says Mr. Malone, (and this guesswork he not only
      called "commentary," but has actually succeeded in making all his
      successor "commentators" accept him as final) to the coronation of Henry
      IV., of France! Again, in the "Merry Wives of Windsor" he finds the words,
      (Act I, scene iii) "Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This shows," says Mr. Malone, "that this comedy must have been written
      after Sir Walter Raleigh's return from Guinia, in 1696. And so on."
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not rehearse the scope and burden of Mr. Malone's painstaking and
      wonderful labors, but, from one instance of the credulity which, once it
      has overmastered the ablest mind, can suppress and subordinate reason,
      judgment, and common sense to a zealous and silly search, we can judge of
      the calm historical value of his "discoveries." In 1808, Mr. Malone
      published <span class="pagenum">087</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a>a
      pamphlet&mdash;"An Account of the Incidents from which the Title and Part
      of the Story of 'The Tempest' were derived, and the Date ascertained." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  By Edmond Malone. London: printed by C. &amp; R. Baldwin,
     Newbridge street, 1808.

     The "Tempest" is the most purely fanciful and poetical of
     the Shakespearean plays, but the commentators determined to
     show that there is nothing fanciful or poetical about it;
     that it is all real: the "Magic Island," a real island; the
     magician Prospero, a real portrait; the "monster," a real,
     living curiosity, which happened to be on exhibition in
     England in the days when the play either was written or
     about to be written, (it makes no difference to these
     gentlemen which) and the storm at sea&mdash;as if the brain which
     conceived the play could not have conceived&mdash;what is not,
     now-a-days, at least, the most uncommon thing in the world&mdash;
     a storm at sea!&mdash;a real historical hurricane!

     In 1839, the Reverend Joseph Hunter, following in the Malone
     footsteps, published "A Disquisition on the Scene, Origin.
     Date, etc., of Shakespeare's Tempest," in which the Magic
     Island is the island of Lampedusa: first, because it is
     uninhabited; secondly, because it is small; thirdly, because
     it lies on the route between Naples and the coast of Africa,
     so that had a prince been traveling from one to the other,
     and wrecked on an island between, he could have been
     conveniently wrecked on this one without going out of his
     course; fourthly, because it bore the reputation (Mr. Hunter
     does not say with whom) of being haunted; fifthly, because
     there was a cell upon it, which Pros-pero might have found
     most opportune for his ghostly residence; and sixthly, that
     the island of Malta gets fire-wood from it. This last fact
     being strongest in the way of proof, because we are told
     that Prospero impressed Ferdinand into his service and kept
     him piling logs of wood.

     But it was reserved for Mr. Edward Dowden, in 1881, to
     locate the island beyond the necessity of further
     conjecture, and to give us accurate sailing directions for
     reaching it. "Prospero's Island," he tells us, "was imagined
     by Shakespeare as within two days' quick sail of Naples,"
     for "Ariel is promised his freedom after two days" (Act I,
     scene ii). "Why two days? The time of the entire action of
     the Tempest is only three hours. What was to be the
     employment of Ariel during two days? To make the winds and
     seas favorable during the voyage." (Dowden's Shakespeare's
     Mind and Art. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1881. p. 373.)
</pre>
    <p>
      It seems that Mr. Malone finds reference to a hurricane that once
      dispersed a certain fleet of a certain nobleman, one Sir George Somers, in
      July, 1609, on a passage, with provisions, for the Virginia Colony; the
      above nobleman, and a Sir Thomas Gates, having been wrecked on the island
      of Bermuda. This discovery is warranty enough for Mr. Malone, and he goes
      on gravely to argue that William Shakespeare not only wrote his "Tempest"
      to commemorate this particular <span class="pagenum">088</span><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a>tempest&mdash;and, as will be seen by an
      examination of the premises, the relation between the occurrence and the
      play is confined merely to the word "tempest" and goes no further&mdash;but
      that he (Shakespeare) did not place the scene of his shipwreck on the
      Bermudas, "because he could spread a greater glamour over the whole by not
      alluding to so well-known islands as the Bermudas." Mr. Malone further
      remarks naively that, "without having read Tacitus, he (Shakespeare) well
      knew that 'omne ignotum pro magnifico est'!" Without pausing to wonder how
      Mr. Malone knew that Shakespeare of Stratford had never read Tacitus&mdash;(a
      slander, by the way, on the omniscient Shakespeare, too&mdash;the man who
      studied Plautus in Greek manuscript, the author of "Julius C√¶sar"&mdash;that
      he had not read a simple Latin historian!)&mdash;or to dwell on the most
      marvelous coincidence between the wreck of Sir George Somers and that of
      Prince Ferdinand <span class="pagenum">089</span><a name="link089"
      id="link089"></a>(the coincidence, according to Malone, being, that one
      was wrecked on the Bermuda and the other wasn't); or ask if a storm at sea
      was so rare an occurrence as to be easily identified; or to note that "the
      tempest" in the play of that name is an episode which covers only about a
      dozen lines of text, and which has absolutely nothing to do with the rest
      of the argument&mdash;without pausing for this, or to remark that Mil
      Malone might have taken to himself the 'omne ignotum pro magnifico est' of
      Tacitus more appositely than heap-plied it either to Sir George Somers or
      the Bermudas, had he reflected as generously as he took it for granted&mdash;it
      is as well to take our leave of Mr. Malone and his labors at this point,
      with a compliment to their zeal and impressment which must be withheld
      from their results. *

    <p>
      And the world would doubtless be as well off could we also here take leave
      of the rest of the Shakespeare-makers. But we are not allowed to do so.
      From the time of Malone onward, the Shakespeare-making,
      Shakespeare-mending, and Shakespeare-cobbling have gone on without
      relaxation. Each fresh rencontre with an emergency in the Shakespearean
      text has necessitated at least one and often several new Shakes-peares.
      And they have been prepared and forthcoming as fast as wanted. Was it
      found that the bard had, of all his worldly goods, left the wife of his
      bosom no recognition save the devise of a ramshackle old bedstead? A score
      of gentlemen hurried to the front to prove that, by law, history, logic,
      custom, and every <span class="pagenum">090</span><a name="link090"
      id="link090"></a>thing else, in those days a "second-best bed" was really
      the most priceless of possessions; of fabulous value, and a fortune in
      itself; and that in no other way could her immortal husband have so
      testified his tender regard and appreciation of Mrs. Shakespeare&mdash;the
      sweet Ann Hathaway of old, who had thrown herself away on a scapegrace
      butcher's son! The fact (as it appears, on inspection of the instrument
      itself, to be) that Mrs. Shakespeare was not even alluded to in the first
      draft of the testament&mdash;her name and the complimentary devise of the
      precious husband's precious "second-best bed" having been written in as "a
      poet's after-thought," and not appearing in the first draft at all&mdash;does
      not affect their statements in the least! They have even gone so far as to
      ascertain that William was no truant lord to willingly desert his lonesome
      lady. According to the very latest authority we are able to cite, the
      fault of the separation was wholly her own. We are assured by a very
      recent explorer that Mrs. Shakespeare "did not accompany her husband to
      London, objecting to the noise and turmoil of that city." *

      Unless it be assumed, therefore, that investigation is reliable in
      proportion to the distance from its subject at which it works, it would
      seem to <span class="pagenum">091</span><a name="link091" id="link091"></a>appear
      that, even if the William Shakespeare we have portrayed were our own
      creation, the creation is actually a nearer resemblance to the William
      Shakespeare known to those nearest to him in residence and time; than the
      inspired genius of the Shakespeareans, who, from Malone downward, have
      rejected every shred of fact they found at hand, and weaved, instead,
      their warp and woof of fiction (and that it is charming and absorbing
      fiction, we are eager to admit) around a vision of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor have the Shakespeareans rested their labors here. Having created a
      Shakespeare to fit the plays, it was necessary to proceed to create a face
      to fit the Shakespeare, and a cranial development wherein might lodge and
      whence might spring the magic of the works he ought to have written. This
      may, very fairly, be called "the young ladies' argument." * "Look on his
      portrait," say the Shakespeareans; "look at that magnificent head!"&mdash;and
      they point to the Chandos portrait&mdash;"is not that the head of a
      genius?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * So the young ladies of New York were of opinion that
     Stokes should not be hanged for the murder of Fisk, "because
     he was so awfully good-looking." <span class="pagenum">092</span><a
      name="link092" id="link092"></a>inspiration&mdash;the ideal
     of the artist, who conceives, in every case, his own
     "Shakespeare;" and if we were called upon for proof that
     "Shakespeare" is quite as much of an ideal to the most of us
     as a "Hamlet," or a "Lear," we could cite, perhaps, nothing
     more convincing than the latitude which is allowed to
     artists with any of the three&mdash;"Shakespeare,"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Was there ever such a head?" We should say, yes, there might have been
      such another head created, even admitting the Chandos portrait to be the
      very counterfeit head of William Shakespeare. But it does not appear, on
      taking the trouble to look into the matter, either that the Chandos
      picture is a portrait, or that&mdash;with one exception&mdash;any other of
      the pictures, casts, masks, busts, or statues of William Shakespeare are
      any thing but works of art, embodying the individual "Hamlet," or "Lear,"
      and the elaborate criticism to which a new "portrait" of either of them is
      subjected&mdash;criticism, which, in the case of a portrait of William
      Shakespeare, in no case pretends to be historical, but is always romantic,
      or sentimental, or picturesque: as to the proper pose of a poet, or the
      correct attitude for a man receiving efflatus directly from the gods;
      never as to the stage manager of the Blackfriars, or the husband of Anne
      Hathaway, or the son of John Shakespeare, of Stratford.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that, as a matter of fact, there never was but one picture of
      the Elizabethan Manager which ever enjoyed any thing in the semblance of a
      certification to its authenticity; and that certification was in the very
      unsatisfactory form of rhyme, in the shape of a set of verses said to have
      been written by Ben Jonson (and, as we propose to show, are quite as
      likely to have been placed under the particular picture without Jonson's
      authority as with it); while, that they were written to fit the particular
      picture in question (for they are in the form of a sort of apostrophe to
      some picture or portrait, and will be hereafter quoted), there seems to be
      no information sufficient to form a belief either way. If they were
      written for that particular picture, and if that particular picture is a
      speaking likeness, then the phrenological, or at least the physiognomical,
      <span class="pagenum">093</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a>argument
      must droop away and die; for the person represented has as stupefied,
      stultified, and insignificant a human countenance as was ever put upon an
      engraver's surface; and, as a matter of fact, no Shakespearean has yet
      been found to admit it as the image of his dream. But, of course, this is
      mere matter of personal opinion, and entitled to no weight whatever in the
      discussion. The question is&mdash;Is there any authentic portrait of
      William Shakespeare, as there is of Elizabeth, Bacon, Raleigh,
      Southampton, and other more or less prominent characters of the age in
      which William Shakespeare is known to have lived and died? Let us do the
      best we can toward investigating this question.

      We have before us a volume, "An Enquiry into the Authenticity of Various
      Pictures and Prints, which, from the Decease of the Poet to our own Times,
      have been offered to the Public as Portraits of Shakespeare. Containing a
      Careful Examination of the Evidence on which they claim to be received; by
      which the Pretended Portraits have been rejected, the Genuine confirmed
      and established," etc., etc. By James Boaden, Esq. * We must content
      ourselves with a simple review of Mr. Boaden's labors. He was a friend and
      disciple of Malone's, and a Shakespearean; a believer in the poet; and he
      writes under the shadow of the mighty name&mdash;the shadow out from under
      which we of this age have stepped, and so become able to inspect, not only
      the facts of history uncurtained by that shadow, but the shadow itself.

      No. 1. William Shakespeare dies in Stratford in 1616. In 1623, appears, on
      the title-page of Heminges and Condell's first folio of the plays, the
      portrait by Martin Droeshout. It is an engraving, and, Mr. Boaden
      believes, a good engraving, of some original picture from which it must
      have been taken; "for," he says, "there were good engravers in those days;
      for Chapman's 'Homer' was published in that year, with a very tine
      engraving of Chapman."

      <span class="pagenum">095</span><a name="link095" id="link095"></a>In this
      picture the head of the subject is represented as rising out of an
      horizontal plain of collar appalling to behold. The hair is straight,
      combed down the sides of the face and bunched over the ears; the forehead
      is disproportionately high; the top of the head bald; the face has the
      wooden expression familiar in the Scotchmen and Indians used as signs by
      tobacconists' shops, accompanied by an idiotic stare that would be but a
      sorry advertisement for the humblest establishment in that trade; and
      which we would be quite as unlikely to look for in the Stratford
      scapegrace as in the immortal bard of the Shakespeareans. It is of this
      picture that Boaden quotes somebody's remark that "it is lucky these
      metrical commendations are not required to be delivered on oath." And
      Steevens says, on the supposition that Ben Jonson, and not the engraver,
      put the copy of verses on the title-page beneath the effigy: "Ben Jonson
      might know little about art, care less about the resemblance, and, never
      having compared the engraving from the picture, have rested satisfied with
      the recollection that the original was a faithful resemblance; and that,
      no doubt, the engraver had achieved all that his art could perform." No.
      2. The edition of the plays of 1690 is accompanied with what is known as
      "Marshall's picture;" which so closely follows, as to face, forehead,
      hair, beard, and collar, the engraving above described, as to suggest that
      it was a copy either of that engraving, or of the unknown picture from
      which that was taken. But, if a copy, it is certainly, from a pictorial
      point of view, an improvement. It looks much more like a man. The
      simpleton stare around the eyes is toned down, and the wooden aspect is
      modified into some<span class="pagenum">096</span><a name="link096"
      id="link096"></a>thing like life. Marshall has taken liberties with the
      dress of No. 1, throwing in a sort of tunic over the left shoulder,
      hitching on an arm with a gauntleted hand grasping a sprig of laurel,
      etc., etc.

      No. 3. The Felton Head.&mdash;"In the catalogue of the fourth exhibition
      and sale by private contract," says Boaden, (page 81),"at the European
      Museum, King Street, St. James Square, 1792." this picture was announced
      to the public in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. 359&mdash;a curious portrait of Shakespeare, painted in 1597."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 31st of May, 1792, a Mr. Felton bought it for five guineas, and, on
      requiring its credentials, received the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. S. Felton, Drayton, Shropshire&mdash;Sir: The head of Shakespeare
      was purchased out of an old house, known by the sign of "The Boar," in
      Eastcheap, London, where Shakespeare and his friends used to resort; and
      report says was painted by a player of that time, but whose name I have
      not been able to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was signed "J. Wilson," who was the conductor of the European
      Museum. This "J. Wilson" appears to have been the original Barnum.
      Although Prince Hal and Falstaff are said in the play to have affected
      "The Boar's head in Eastcheap," it does not appear, except from Mr. "J.
      Wilson," that "Shakespeare and his friends" ever resorted thither. There
      was an old inn in Eastcheap, but it was not called "The Boar's Head."
      There <i>was</i> an inn by that name, however, in Blackfriars, near the
      theater, from which the manager might have borrowed it. Then, again, Mr.
      "J. Wilson" seemed to have forgotten the great fire in London in 1666,
      which, "in a few hours, <span class="pagenum">097</span><a name="link097"
      id="link097"></a>in a strong east wind, left the whole of Eastcheap a mass
      of smoking ruins, and the wretched inhabitants could think of saving
      nothing but their lives." Mr. Wilson subsequently amended his story so as
      to read that "it was found between four and five years ago at a broker's
      shop at the Minories by a man of fashion, whose name must be concealed,"
      etc., etc. Mr. Steevens, who scouted the other pictures as spurious,
      accepted this picture, for a time, as the original of the engravings we
      have called No. 1 and No. 2; but finally, the whole thing exploded and was
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 4. The Bust in Stratford Church.&mdash;This was carved by nobody knows
      whom, from nobody knows what, nobody knows when; for the statement that it
      was cut by "Gerard Johnson," an Amsterdam "tomb-maker," is invariably
      accepted, but can be traced to no historical source. Says Boaden (page
      81), "The performance is not too good for a native sculptor." In 1623
      Leonard Digges alludes to it in a few verses well known. It seems to have
      been originally colored, but there is no testimony as to the original
      colors. In 1748, one hundred and twenty-five years after Digges, John
      Hall, a Stratford artist, "restored" it, painting the eyes a light hazel,
      and the hair and beard auburn. This was "a good enough" Shakespeare for
      all practical purposes for the next half-hundred years or so. But in 1793
      came Mr. Malone. He caused the bust&mdash;in deference, probably, to a
      purer taste and a sense of churchly propriety&mdash;to be covered
      completely with a thick coat of white paint. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  While these pages are going through the press (April,
     1879), however, we find a statement that within a year or
     two (and since the writer of these pages visited it) one
     Simon Colling has applied a bath to the bust&mdash;removing
     Malone's whitewash, and revealing the identical auburn hair
     and hazel eyes which tradition had asserted to be
     underneath.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">098</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a>From
      this bust, Mr. Boaden says, a Mr. Bullock once took a cast, which is
      sometimes engraved as frontispiece to an edition of the plays, in which
      case it is entitled "Cast of the head of William Shakespeare, taken after
      death," which may or may not&mdash;for Mr. Boaden can not tell us who this
      "Mr. Bullock" was&mdash;be the German "Death Mask" noticed further on, (at
      any rate the statement "taken after death"&mdash;"William Shakespeare
      being unquestionably dead at the time&mdash;is literally true.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The bust represents its subject as possessing a magnificent head,
      admirably proportioned, with no protruding "bumps." The face is
      represented as breaking into a smile. According to this effigy,
      Shakespeare must have had an extraordinarily long upper lip, the distance
      between the base of the nose and the mouth being remarkably out of
      proportion with the other facial developments; there seems to be a little
      difficulty, too, about the chin, which is pulled out into what appears to
      be a sort of extra nose; but, nevertheless, the Stratford bust represents
      a fine, soldierly-looking man, with a fierce military mustache cocked up
      at the ends, and a goatee. If Ben Jonson&mdash;knowing his friend William
      Shakespeare to have been the martial and altogether elegant-looking
      gentleman the Stratford bust represents him&mdash;authorized the verses we
      have already quoted to be placed under the "Droe-shout engraving," it was
      a deliberate libel on his part, and as gross as it was deliberate, and
      only perhaps to <span class="pagenum">099</span><a name="link099"
      id="link099"></a>be explained by Jonson's alleged secret enmity to, or
      jealousy of, William Shakespeare, his rival playwright, which we shall be
      called to examine at length further on. *

      No. 5. "The Chandos Portrait." This picture, so termed because once the
      property of the Duke of Chandos, is the best known of all the so-called
      portraits&mdash;being, in fact, the one from which the popular idea of
      Shakespeare is derived; therefore, when a man is said to resemble
      Shakespeare, it is meant to be conveyed that he bears a likeness to the
      Chandos picture. Mr. Malone announced that it was painted in 1607, but
      never gave any other authority than his own ipse dixit for the statement,
      not even taking the trouble to refer, like Mr. J. Wilson, to "a man of
      fashion, whose name must be concealed." Mr. Boaden lays (page 42) that he
      once saw it, and compared it "with what had been termed a fine copy, I
      think by Piamberg, and found it utterly unlike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," he continues, "I never saw any thing that resembled it." He also
      says (pages 41-42) that "the copies by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr.
      Humphrey were not only unlike the original, but were unlike each other,
      one being smiling and the other grave." That is to say, that not only have
      the romancers constructed "biographies," but the artists have kept up with
      them; and we may, every one of us, select our own Shakespeare to-day&mdash;poet
      or potman, scholar or clown, tall or short, fair or dark; we may each suit
      our own tastes with a Shakespeare to our liking. Mr. Boaden continues
      (page 49): "It" (the Chandos) "was very probably painted by Burbage,"
      <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>the
      great tragedian, who is known to have handled the pencil; it is said to
      have been the property of Joseph Taylor, our poet's Hamlet, who, dying
      about 1653, at the advanced age of seventy, left the picture by will to
      Davenant. At the death of Davenant in 1663, it was bought by Betterton,
      the actor, and when he died Mr. Robert Keck, of the Inner Temple, gave
      Mrs. Barry, the actress, forty guineas for it. From Mr. Keck it passed to
      Mr. Nichol, of Southgate, whose daughter married the Marquis of
      Caernarvon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steevens, whom Boaden quotes (page 43), declined to be convinced by this
      genealogy, and said, "Gossip rumor had given out that Davenant was more
      than Shakespeare's godson. * What folly, therefore, to suppose that he
      should possess a genuine portrait of the poet, when his lawful daughters
      had not one! Mrs. Barry was an actress of acknowledged gallantry; as she
      received forty guineas for the picture, something more animated might have
      been included though not specified in the bargain," etc., etc. Steevens
      was fond of calling this picture "the Davenantico Bet<span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>tertono-Barryan-Keckian-Hicolsian-Chandosian
      portrait."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  There is a story that once, on the occasion of one of
     Shakespeare's visits to Stratford, a villager, meeting young
     Davenant in the street, asked him where he was going. "To
     the inn, to see my godfather Shakespeare," said the lad.
     "Beware how you take the name of God in vain, my lad," said
     the other. The allusions to William's gallantries are
     numerous. On the Stratford parish records there is entry of
     the birth of one "Thomas Green, <i>alias</i> Shakespeare." The
     tale of the interrupted amour, at the theater, of "Richard
     the Third" and "William the Conqueror," as is apt to be the
     case, is about the most widely familiar of the Shakespearean
     stories, and unnecessary to be repeated here. But Davenant
     was proud to claim the dishonor of his mother, and
     Shakespeare for his father, to his dying day.
</pre>
    <p>
      "There are," says Boaden (page 53), "a few circumstances relating to the
      picture of which some notice should be taken in this examination. There
      is, it seems, a tradition that, no original picture of Shakespeare
      existing, Sir Thomas Clarges caused a" (i. e., this) "portrait to be
      painted from a young man who had the good fortune to resemble him" (i. e.,
      Shakespeare. Query: How did Sir Thomas know that the young man resembled
      Shakespeare?). Mr. Malone traced this story to "The Gentleman's Magazine"
      for August, 1759, and called on the writer for his authority; but the
      writer, whoever he was, never gave it, any more than Malone gave his
      authority for announcing its date to be 1607; but Malone himself says that
      "most reports of this kind are an adumbration of some fact, and indication
      of something in kind or degree similar or analogous."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 6. This is a portrait, so called, by Zuccharo, which need not detain
      us, since Mr. Boaden himself demonstrates very clearly that it was not in
      any event painted from life, and, not improbably, did not originally claim
      to have been intended for Shakespeare at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boaden's No. 7 is the "Cornelius Jansen picture," and to this Mr.
      Boaden pins his earnest faith. He says this "is now in the collection of
      the Duke of Somerset;" but he appears to make no attempt to connect it
      with William Shakespeare except as follows: Cornelius Jansen is said to
      have painted the daughter of Southampton&mdash;ergo, he might have been
      Southampton's family painter, and Southampton might have been desirous to
      possess a portrait of his friend Shakespeare done by his own painter&mdash;ergo,
      Jansen might <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>have
      had William Shakespeare for a sitter! This is all the authority for the
      authenticity. But that it is&mdash;judging from the engraving in Mr.
      Boaden's book&mdash;a magnificent picture, we think there can be no
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the supposition that the Chandos is an authentic likeness of
      Shakespeare, this Jansen certainly bears a strong Shakespearean
      resemblance. In it the hair is curling, as in the Chandos, not straight,
      as in the Droeshout and the Marshall engravings. The mustache, which is
      cut tight to the face without being shaved, as in the Droeshout, and
      strong and heavy, as in the bust, is lighter than the Chandos, while the
      beard is fuller. There is nothing of the tremendous upper lip represented
      in the bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boaden (page 195) describes it as an eye-witness, he having had access
      to it for the purposes of the book before us. He says: "It is an early
      picture by Cornelius Jansen, tenderly and beautifully painted. Time seems
      to have treated it with infinite kindness, for it is quite pure, and
      exhibits its original surface.... The portrait is on panel, and attention
      will be required to prevent a splitting of the oak, in two places, if my
      eyes have not deceived me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Earlom, who copied the picture, Boaden says: "He had lessened the
      amplitude of the forehead; he had altered the form of the skull; he had
      falsified the character of the mouth; and, though his engraving was still
      beautiful, and the most agreeable exhibition of the poet, I found it would
      be absolutely necessary to draw the head again, as if he had never
      exercised his talent upon it" (page 195). Mr. Boaden specifies further the
      picture laid to have once decorated the pair of bellows belonging to Queen
      Elizabeth's <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>own
      private apartments, besides still one other, both of which he rejects as
      spurious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, it has taken an army of novelists, painters, engravers, and
      essayists to erect simple William Shakespeare of Stratford into the god he
      ought to have been; and, on the best examination we are enabled to make,
      and according to the Shakespeareans themselves, there is only one picture
      of William Shakespeare extant which has the even assumed advantage of
      having been pronounced a likeness by any one who ever saw William
      Shakespeare himself in his (William Shakespeare's) lifetime. Even if&mdash;as
      Mr. Steevens surmises&mdash;this eye witness never saw the engraving, but
      only the original portrait from which it was copied, the Droeshout still
      enjoys an authentication possessed by no other so-called likeness, and, if
      rejected&mdash;as it infallibly is by all devout Shakespeareans&mdash;there
      remains nothing of certitude, nothing even of the certitude of conjecture,
      as to the features of the Stratford boy, whoever he was, and whatever his
      works. One further effort was, however, made, so lately as 1849, to clinch
      this "young lady's argument," by yet one more genuine discovery. This time
      it was a "Becker 'death mask!'" A plaster mask of an anonymous dead face
      is found in a rubbish-shop in Mayence, in 1849. Regarded as a mask of
      William Shakespeare, it bears a certain resemblance to the Stratford bust;
      and, regarded as a mask of Count Bismarck (for example), it would be found
      to bear a very strong resemblance to Count Bismarck. (We write from an
      inspection of photographs only, never having seen the mask.) Having always
      been annoyed that a creature so immortal <span class="pagenum">104</span><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a>as they had created their Shakespeare left
      no death-mask, the Shakespeareans at once adopt this anonymous mask as
      taken from the face of the two-days defunct William Shakespeare, who died
      in 1616. <i>Credat Judams!</i> Either William Shakespeare, at his death,
      was known to be an immortal bard or he was not. If he was, how could the
      sole likeness moulded of departed greatness be smuggled away from the land
      that was pious to claim him as its most distinguished son and nobody miss
      it, or raise the hue and cry? If he was not, to whose interest was it to
      steal the mask from the family who cared enough about the dead man's
      memory to go to the expense of it? But, at any rate, in 1849 it falls into
      the hands of jealous believers. They search upon it for hairs of auburn
      hue, and for the date of their hero's death, and they find both. Had they
      made up their minds to find a scrap of Shakespearean cuticle, we may be
      sure it would have been there. Professor Owen, of the British Museum,
      declared that, if the fact of the mask having originally come from England
      could be established, there was "hardly any sum of money which the Museum
      would not pay for the mask itself." But the missing testimony has not been
      supplied, though doubtless it is incubating. For now and then we see a
      newspaper paragraph to the effect that old paintings have turned up (in
      pawn-shops invariably) which "resemble the death-mask," thus accustoming
      us to the title, which, in time, we shall doubtless come to accept&mdash;as
      we have come to accept Shakespeare himself&mdash;from mere force of habit.
      The last of these discoveries is in Australia, farther off than even

      portrait of Shakespeare claims no authority further than a resemblance to
      the accepted ideal, and the terra-cotta bust in the possession of the
      Garrick club was "found to order," and represents a man who, it would
      seem, bore not even a resemblance to the accepted Shakespearean features.

      We should, perhaps, mention that Mr. Boaden surmises that the Droeshout
      picture is a portrait of William Shakespeare the actor, in the character
      of "Old Ivnowell," and that the Stratford bust was caused to be executed
      by Dr. Hall, a son-in-law of its subject, and was the work of one Thomas
      Stanton, who followed a cast taken after death. But, as Mr. Boaden admits,
      this is his surmise only. However insuperable, therefore, in the run of
      cases, the "young ladies argument" to prove from the pictures that William
      Shakespeare was not author of the plays is quite weak enough; but, as an
      argument to prove that he was such author, it is weakness and impotence
      itself.

    <p>
      It now becomes necessary to ask the ordinary question which a court would
      be obliged to ask concerning any exhibit produced before it, and claimed
      as authentic or authoritative: namely, Where did the plays called
      Shakespeare's come from? how did they get into print? who, if anybody,
      delivered the "copy" to the printer, and vouched for its authorship? It is
      manifest that we have no business here with any question of criticism, or
      as to an authenticity between different editions of the <span
      class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>same play;
      but the plays were written to be played; how did they come to be published
      so that millions of readers, who never entered a playhouse where they were
      performed, read and still read them?
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to arrive at any supposition as to these considerations which
      would be of value to our purpose in these papers, it will be necessary to
      glance at the state of literary property in the days between 1585 and
      1606. How, in those days, there was absolutely no legal protection for an
      author's manuscript. Once it had strayed beyond the writer's hand it was
      practically "publici juris"&mdash;any body's property. The first law of
      copyright enacted in England was the act of Anne, of April 10, 1710, more
      than one hundred years after the last date at which commentators claim the
      production of a Shakespearean play. Even the first authoritative
      pronunciation of a competent tribunal as to literary property at common
      law (which preceded, of course, all literary property definable by
      statute) was not made until 1769, fifty-nine years later. But the Court of
      Star Chamber (of obscure origin, but known to have been of powerful
      jurisdiction in the time of Henry VII.) was in the height of its ancient
      omnipotence in those years. And of the various matters of which it took
      cognizance, one of the earliest was the publishing, printing, and even the
      keeping and reading of books. Under date of June 23,1585&mdash;the year
      that many commentators assign as that in which William Shakespeare first
      turned up in London&mdash;this Star Chamber, which had already issued many
      such, issued a decree that none should "print any book, work, or copy,
      against the form or meaning of any restraint contained in any statute of
      laws of this realm," except, <span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a>etc., etc. Twenty-nine years before&mdash;in
      1556&mdash;Philip and Mary had erected ninety-seven booksellers into a
      body called "The Stationers' Company," who were to monopolize the printing
      of books, if they so chose. They had given them power and authority&mdash;and
      their second charter, in 1558, confirmed them in it&mdash;to print such
      books as they obtained, either from authors' manuscripts or translations,
      and to see very carefully that nobody else printed them. Their power was
      absolute&mdash;they had their "privilegium ad imprimendum solum," and in
      the pursuit of any body who interfered with it they were empowered to
      "break locks, search, seize," and, in short, to suppress any printed
      matter they did not choose to license, wherever they pleased. This the
      Worshipful Company of Stationers did not fail to do; they pursued, and the
      Star Chamber convicted. The disgraceful record of infamous and inhuman
      prosecutions and punishments for reading, keeping, selling, or making
      books might well detain us here, did our scope permit. * Whatever
      literature accomplished in those days it accomplished by stealth, in
      defiance of the implacable and omnipotent Star Chamber and its bloodhound,
      the Stationers' Company, who ran in its victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can not, we think, be doubted, by a student of those times, * that
      whatever literary property existed <span class="pagenum">108</span><a
      name="link108" id="link108"></a>at common law then existed in the shape of
      a license to print a work under permission of the Stationers' Company;
      that no estate or property obtained in anything except the types, ink,
      paper, in the license to use them all together to make a book, and in the
      resulting volume; and that what we understand by "copyright" to-day&mdash;namely,
      an author's or a proprietor's right to demand a royalty or percentage, or
      to exercise other control over the work when once printed and published&mdash;was
      altogether unconceived and unclaimed.

      We are aware that this statement as to the condition of authors' rights in

      Whatever compensation the author of a work was able to obtain, he
      doubtless obtained beforehand, by sale of his manuscript, and dreamed not
      of setting up a tangible property as against any one who had obtained the
      Stationers' Company's license to print it. The Stationers' Company, at the
      outset of their career, opened a record, in which it entered the name of
      every book it licensed&mdash;the date, and the name of the person
      authorized to print it. * It was not until 1644, twenty-eight years after
      William Shakespeare's death (so far as we can ever know) that John Milton,
      in his "Are-opagitica"&mdash;the greatest state paper in the republic

      Once in their hands, printers did what they pleased with a manuscript;
      abridged it if they found it too long, and lengthened it if they found it
      too short. Thomas Nashe says, that, in a play of his, called "The Isle of
      Dogs," four acts, without his consent "or the least guesse of his drifte
      or scope," were added by the printers. * The printers also assigned the
      authorship of the work to any name they thought would help sell the book,
      and dedicated it to whom they pleased. (Just as the first printer of the
      sonnets we call Shakespeare's, dedicated them to "W. H.," which two
      initials have supplied the Shakespeareans with an excuse for at least as
      many dozen octavo volumes of conjecture as to who "W. H." was.) Sometimes
      the author thus despotically assigned to the work rebelled. Dr. Heywood
      recognized two of his own compositions in a collection of verses called
      "The Passionate Pilgrim," printed by one Jaggard, in 1599, upon the
      title-page to which, this Jaggard had placed the name of William
      Shakespeare as author. Hey-wood publicly claimed his own, but William
      Shakespeare never denied or affirmed; his name, however, was removed by
      the printer from the title-page of the <span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a>third edition of the book, in 1612. * But,
      as a rule, the Stationers' Company were too powerful, and the author too
      poor, to bring the trick to exposure.

      It was under these circumstances, and in times like these, that the
      Shakespearean plays began to appear in print. Where did they come from?
      They were written to be played. According to all accounts they were very
      valuable to the theater which produced them. Every personal and selfish
      interest of the proprietors, whether of the theater or of the manuscript
      plays, dictated that they should be kept in secret&mdash;least of all that
      they should be printed and made accessible to the public outside of the
      theater, who otherwise, to see them, must become patrons of the house
      where they were performed. That the author or authors of the plays could
      have made them of more profit by selling them to the printers than to the
      players is doubtful; that they personally entered them&mdash;or such of
      them as were entered&mdash;on the books of the Stationers' Company, is
      certainly not the fact; the only persons to whose interest it was to print
      them were the printers themselves, and, in all probability, it was the
      printers who did cause them to be printed. But where did these printers
      procure the "copy" from which to set up the plays they printed? The
      question will never be answered. The manuscripts might have been procured
      by bribing individual actors, each of whom could have easily furnished a
      copy of his individual part, and so the whole be made up for the press.
      The fact that the plays never were printed without more or less of the
      stage directions or "business" included, lends probability to this theory:
      <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>but, as
      to whether a play made up in this fashion would have resulted in any thing
      like what we possess to-day, we have considered further on. Mr. Grant
      White admits, * as must everybody who examines into the matter, that
      whatever the printers printed was unauthorized and surreptitious. But,
      having admitted this much, Mr. White is too ardent a Shakespearean not to
      make some effort to throw a guise of authenticity around the text he has
      so lovingly followed. In the article we have just quoted from in our
      foot-note, he says, "It is not improbable that, in case of great and
      injurious misrepresentation of the text of a play by" this surreptitious
      method of publication, "fair copies were furnished by the theatrical
      people at the author's request in self-defence." Perhaps these plays might
      have found their way into print just as the comedy of "Play" found its way
      into print in 1868, ** or the play of "Mary Warner," *** at about the same
      date. At any rate the editors of the first folio speak of the "stolne and
      surreptitious copies" which had preceded them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "Such of his plays as were published during his lifetime
     seem to have been given to the press entirely without his
     agency; indeed, his interest was against their
     publication.... It was the interest of all concerned,
     whether as proprietors, or only as actors, or, like himself,
     as both, that the theaters should have the entire benefit of
     whatever favor they enjoyed with the public. But the
     publishers, or stationers, as they were then called, eagerly
     sought copies of them for publication, and obtained them
     surreptitiously: sometimes, it would seem, by corrupting
     persons connected with the theater, and sometimes, as the
     text which they printed shows, by sending short-hand writers
     to the performance."

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112" id="link112"></a>The
      first and second editions of "Hamlet," says Mr. White, "in 1603 and 1604,
      might have been the result of such maneuvers on the part of the printers
      and the stenographers, or those who had access to the manuscripts of the
      author. However this may be, twenty of Shakespeare's plays were published
      by various stationers during his lifetime; they are known as the quartos,
      from the form in which they are printed. They are most of them full of
      errors.... Some of them seem to have been put in type from stage copies,
      or, not improbably, from an aggregation of the separate parts which were
      in the hands of the various actors." In other words, Shakespeare's works
      were so imperfectly printed, against his will, during his lifetime, that
      he himself authorized <i>other imperfect</i>&mdash;Mr. White says they
      were imperfect&mdash;versions to be likewise printed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. White might have looked nearer home to more purpose. Nobody knows,
      nobody can know better than he, that what is called the "accepted" or
      "received" text of Shakespeare (if there is, to speak minutely, any such
      to-day) has been arrived at and made up piecemeal, and in the course of
      time, by the commentators selecting from the folios, and other original
      editions, such "readings" as the judgment of scholarship or the taste of
      criticism has, on the whole, adopted; and any body who cares to take the
      trouble to examine these original editions can see as much for himself. To
      suppose that this text, as it stands to-day, is the text as its author or
      authors wrote it, is, it seems to us, to suppose at least ten thousand
      coincidences, every one of which is, to say the least, improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before proceeding any further, let us recapitulate <span class="pagenum">113</span><a
      name="link113" id="link113"></a>the three historical certainties to which
      we have arrived. First, that the state of the law was favorable, (indeed,
      it would be impossible to conceive of a state more favorable), to literary
      imposture or incognito. Second, that nobody stands on record as claiming
      to know the authorship of these plays, except the printers, who were able
      to sell them by using the name of the manager of a popular theater; and,
      therefore, whose interest it was to affix that name to them; and, Third,
      that there was never a period in which it was so reasonably an author's
      interest to be anonymous, or preserve his incognito, as these very years
      covered by the lifetime of William Shakespeare; when, between the
      Stationers' Company and the Star Chamber, it was a fortunate author,
      printer or reader, who escaped hanging, disemboweling, and quartering,
      with only the loss of ears or liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who wrote these plays? London was full of playwrights, contemporary with
      William Shakespeare, many of them his friends and familiars; possibly, all
      of them submitting their manuscripts to his editorial eye. We have their
      works extant to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Jonson was a poet and a pedant; Greene, a university-bred man. And we
      may go through the list and verify the records of them all, and find in
      each some quality or training from which to reasonably expect fruitage.
      But nobody has ever ventured to hazard so wild a theory as that any of
      them wrote the anonymous immortal plays to which the best of their own
      acknowledged masterpieces are mere rubbish. But a butcher's boy, lately
      from Stratford, happens to be manager of a contemporary theater. He, there<span
      class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>fore, must be
      the writer, and there can not be the slightest doubt of it. The story that
      this boy ever stole deer is rejected as resting on insufficient evidence.
      But no evidence is required to prove his authorship of the topmost works
      in the history or the literature of England. We have seen the monopoly
      that overruled the press. We have seen that the Stationers' Company
      insisted upon recording the name and ownership of every printed thing; and
      their record-books are still extant, and bear no trace of any such
      claimant as William Shakespeare. We have weighed the surmises of the
      Shakespeareans as to these times, and seen their probable value; and have
      found it just as impossible to connect the immortal fragments we call the
      Shakespearean plays to-day with William Shakespeare, of Stratford, as we
      have already found it to imagine him as having access to the material, the
      sealed records, and the hidden muniments employed in their construction.
      Is there any more evidence to be examined?
    </p>
    <p>
      But were these plays, so printed <i>outside</i>, the same plays as those
      acted <i>inside</i> the theater? When we recall the style of audiences
      that assembled in those days (M. Taine says the spectators caroused and
      sang songs while the plays progressed; that they drank great draughts of
      beer; and, if they drank too much, burned juniper instead of retiring;
      anon, they would break upon the stage, toss in a blanket such performers
      as pleased them not, tear up the properties, etc., etc.)&mdash;when we
      recall this, it is not the easiest thing in the world to imagine this
      audience so very highly delighted, for instance, with Wolsey's long
      soliloquy (which the actor of to-day delivers in a dignified, low, and
      unimpassioned monotone, without gesture), or <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>Hamlet's philosophical monologues, or
      Isabella's pious strains. <i>Some</i> plays were highly popular inside
      those theaters. Were these the ones? Mr. Grant White has all reason,
      probability, and common sense on his side, when he insists that the
      theater most jealously guarded the manuscripts of the plays that were
      making its fortune; and that it would have been suicide in it to have
      circulated them outside, in print. But may not the echo of the popularity
      of certain plays called "Hamlet," "King John," "Macbeth," etc., have
      induced others, outside the theater, to have circulated plays, christened
      with these names (or with and under the popular name of Shakespeare), for
      gain among the "unco guid" who would not, or the impecunious who could
      not, enter the theater door? There is no need of opening up so hopeless a
      speculation&mdash;a speculation pure and simple, that can never, in the
      nature of things, be confronted by data either way. But the fact does
      remain that these marvelous plays appeared in print contemporaneously with
      the professional career of an actor named William Shakespeare, and in the
      same town where he acted; that, if they were his, it would have been to
      his interest to have kept them out of print; and that their appearance in
      print he most certainly did not authorize; and who can claim that one
      guess is not as good as another, where history is silent, and tradition
      askew, and the truth buried under the dust of centuries, overtopped yy the
      rubbish of conjecture? We repeat, we have no warrant to intrude upon the
      domain of criticism. The Shakespearean text, as we possess it to-day, is
      too priceless, whatever its source, to be rudely touched. But, so far as
      is revealed by the record of its appearance <span class="pagenum">116</span><a
      name="link116" id="link116"></a>among printed literature, there is no
      evidence, internal or external, as to William Shakespeare's production of
      it, and as to its origin we are as hopelessly in the dark as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dubious as is the chronicle of those days as to other matters, it is
      singularly clear as to what was printed and what was not. For those were
      the sort of days when men whose names were not written in the books of the
      Stationers' Company printed at the peril of clipped ears and slit noses,
      or worse; and those books are still extant. But, by the fatality which
      seems to follow and pervade the name of William Shakespeare, this record,
      like every other, national or local, yields nothing to the probe but
      disappointment and silence as to the man of Stratford and the actor of
      Blackfriars.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will, presently, consider as to whether the same intellect composed the
      "Hamlet" at one sitting, and at another, located Bohemia on the sea-coast;
      and whether, on inspection, it might not be strongly suggested that the
      two conceptions indicated geniuses of quite different orders and not one
      and the same person; that one showed the hand-marks of a poet and the
      other the hand-marks of the stage-manager, etc. If the limits of this work
      permitted, we believe the same hand-marks might be collected from the
      treatment of the text of every play. For instance, the "Comedy of Errors"
      is supposed to occur during the days when Ephesus was ruled by a duke, and
      follows&mdash;as we have already shown&mdash;the unities of the Men√¶chmi
      of Plautus. But the ignoramus who doctored the paraphrase for the
      Blackfriars stage found it convenient, to bring on his stage effect, to
      introduce a Christian monastery into Ephesus at about that time, <span
      class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a>with a lady
      abbess who could refuse admission to the duke himself, so inviolable and
      sacred was the sanctuary of consecrated Christian walls! The monastery was
      as convenient to bringing all the befogged and befooled and sadly mixed up
      personages of the comedy face to face at the moment, as was the seashore
      and the bear, in "A Winter's Tale," to account for the princess Perdita
      among the shepherds, and so in they all go. These, and the like brummagem
      and ruses de convenances, are simple enough to understand, and detract in
      no degree whatever from the value of the plays: they can be retired or
      retained at pleasure, and no harm done, if we only remember to whom and to
      what they are assignable. But, if we forget that, and insist that the very
      same pen which wrote the dialogue wrote the setting&mdash;wrote every
      entrance, exit, and direction to the scene-shifters and stage-carpenters,
      and, therefore, that every dot and comma, every call and cue, every "gag"
      and localism, is as sacred as holy writ, no wonder the scholars of the
      text are puzzled!
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we find that Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Harper, in the "American
      Catholic Review" for January, 1879&mdash;who otherwise believe the author
      of the Shakespearean plays to have been a roman catholic&mdash;are almost
      persuaded that he must have been a protestant, because he finds occasion
      to make mention of an "evening mass." But let us assure Messrs. Wilkes and
      Harper that they need neither abandon nor adopt a theory on rencontre with
      so trivial a phenomenon. If William Shakespeare felt the need of an
      "evening mass" at any time, we may be fairly sure, from our experience of
      that worthy, that he put one in. He had bolted too many camels <span
      class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>in his day to
      hesitate at such a gnat as that! The creator of a convent in old Ephesus
      and of a sea-coast to Bohemia was not one to stick at a trifling "evening
      mass!"

      The gentlemen above mentioned, believe the author of the plays to have
      been a romanist, not because the reverend Richard Davies, writing soon
      after 1685, distinctly says "he died a Papist," (for any statement made
      anywhere within a hundred years of William Shakespeare's lifetime is "mere
      gossip," and it is only the biographies we write now-a-days that are to be
      relied upon), but mainly because the liturgy and priesthood of that church
      are invariably treated with respect in the plays, while dissenting parsons
      are poked fun at without stint. Doubtless, in the modern drama the same
      rule will be perceived to obtain. The imperious liturgy and priesthood of
      the roman or of the stately anglican church appear to be beyond the
      attempts of travesty; while the snivel and preach of mere puritanism has
      always been too tempting an opportunity for "Aminadab Sleek" and his type&mdash;to
      be resisted, and such a fact would justify very little conclusion either
      way. Besides, there is no call to insist that the stage, in epitomizing
      life into the compass of an hour, shall preserve every detail; nothing
      less than a Chinese theater could answer a demand like that. There is a
      dramatic license even broader than the license accorded to poetry, and we
      would doubtless find the drama a sad bore if there were not. William
      Shakespeare, during his managerial career, appears to have understood this
      as well as any body; nor have the liberties he took with facts and
      chronology befogged any body, except the <span class="pagenum">119</span><a
      name="link119" id="link119"></a>daily lessening throng of investigators,
      who believe him to be the original of the masterpieces he cut into
      play-hooks for his stage.

      But did William Shakespeare ever try his hand at verse-making? There is
      considerable rumor to the effect that, during the leisure of his later
      life, no less than in the lampooning efforts of his vagrom youth, he did
      turn his pen to rhymes. And the future may yet bring forth a Shakespearean
      honest enough to collect these verses&mdash;as they follow here&mdash;and
      to entitle them&mdash;

     *  Ashmolean MS. same as preceding. Both the above are given
     by Mr. Grant White. Shakespeare, vol. I, p. ci.

     **  This is given to us by Mr. S. W. Fullom (History of
     William Shakespeare, Player and Poet; with New Facts and
     Traditions. London: Saunders, Oatley &amp; Co., 1864, p. 133,)
     with the following note: "The manner in which this fragment
     was recovered is not different from that to which we owe so
     many local ballads, known only to the common people. About
     1690, Joshua Barnes, the Greek Professor at Cambridge, was
     in an inn at Stratford, when he heard an old woman singing
     these stanzas, and, discerning the association with
     Shakespeare, offered her ten guineas to repeat the whole
     ballad. This, however, she was unable to do, having
     forgotten the remaining portion." Mr. Fullom says these
     verses "reveal the Shakespearean touch," and alludes to a
     scandal touching Lady Lucy's infidelity to her husband.

     The following additional verses were furnished by John
     Jordan, who altered the above stanza into the same meter,
     and asserted the whole to be Shakespeare, as unearthed and
     restored by himself:

     He's a haughty, proud, insolent knight of the shire

     At home nobody loves, yet there's many that fear;

     If Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miscall it&mdash;

     Synge lowsie Luey, whatever befall it.

     To the Sessions he went, and did lowdly complain

     His park had been robbed and his deere they were slain;

     This Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miseall it&mdash;

     Synge lowsie Luey, whatever befall it.

     He sayd It was a ryot, his men had been beat,

     His venison was stol'n and clandestinely eat:

     So Lucy is lowsie as some volke miscall it&mdash;

     Synge lowsie Luey, whatever befall it.

     So haughty was he when the fact was confessed

     He sayd 'twas a wrong that could not be redressed;

     So Luey is lowsie, as some volke miseall it&mdash;

     Synge lowsie Luey, whatever befall it.

     Though luces a dozen he wear on his coat,

     His name it shall lowsie for Luey be wrote;

     For Luey is lowsie, as some volke miseall it&mdash;

     We'll sing lowsie Lucy, whatever befall it.

     If a juvenile frolic he can not forgive,

     We'll sing lowsie Lucy as long as we live;

     And Luey the lowsie a libel may call it&mdash;

     We'll sing lowsie Lucy whatever befall it.

      Some lampoon was affixed by young William to Sir Thomas Lucy's park gate,
      and enraged the baronet to such a degree that&mdash;according to Capell&mdash;he
      directed a lawyer at Warwick to commence a prosecution against the lad.
      The Lucy note, however, makes no mention of the lawyer, only stating that
      young Shakespeare deemed it prudent to quit Stratford, "at least for a
      time." The long ballad of six stanzas (which we give in the foot-note) was
      written by John Jordan, a harmless rustic who lived at Stratford in the
      days of Malone and Ireland, i. e. in the last years of the eighteenth
      century, and went about claiming to have inherited the mantle of
      Shakespeare. The "Piping Pebworth" verses, and perhaps the whole story was
      written by him.

      which, according to the local traditions of Stratford, his home, where he
      was born, lived, and died&mdash;where alone, for a century or more after
      his death his reputation was cherished&mdash;William Shakespeare ever
      produced. There is nothing: in them inconsistent with the record of the
      man himself; and, so far as we know, have never been rejected by the
      Shakespeareans themselves. It certainly would not be honest, in our
      present appeal to history, to insert in this edition&mdash;we may fairly
      call it "The Stratford Edition"&mdash;of Master Shakespeare's poetry, all
      that he edited for the stage; or, worse yet, borrowed and dressed up, and&mdash;according
      to Robert Greene&mdash;passed for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are very far from desiring even to do justice to poor Robert Greene, if
      in so doing we shall detract a hair's weight from the merits of William
      Shakespeare. But it is not impossible to say a good word even for Greene.
      Although his language is not within such bounds of propriety as the
      Shakespeareans could wish, <span class="pagenum">125</span><a
      name="link125" id="link125"></a>modern research has amply proved that he
      told the truth, and that William Shakespeare borrowed, or rather seized
      upon and adopted, without compensation, the work by which Greene earned
      his bread. For Greene's language, Chettle, Greene's editor, makes haste,
      sometime afterward, when William Shakespeare had been taken up by "divers
      of worship" to apologize, as far as an editor can apologize for an author.
      We shall see, further on, how William Shakespeare was shrewd enough to
      make himself useful to these "divers of worship," and in those days, and
      for a century after, no slavery was so abject as the slavery of letters to
      patronage. So, of course, Chettle hastened to make his peace with them
      too. But the truth remains, nevertheless, that poor Greene told only the
      truth. It is fashionable with the Shakespeareans to sneer at Greene,
      because he was "jealous" of Shakespeare. He appears to have had reason to
      be jealous! But no name is bad enough to bestow on him. Mr. Grant White
      says: "Robert Greene, writing from the fitting deathbed of a groveling
      debauchee, warns three of his literary companions to shun intercourse
      with," etc., "certain actors, Shakespeare among the rest." If Robert
      Greene died from over-debauch, it is no more than Shakespeare himself died
      of, according to the entry in the diary of the Rev. John Ward. "It is not
      impossible," says Mr. White, "even that this piece of gossiping tradition
      is true." Mr. White is right to call it "gossiping tradition," for it is
      piece and parcel of all the other mention of William Shakespeare of
      Stratford. If it were not for "gossiping tradition," we had never heard,
      and Mr. White had never written, of that personage. But <span
      class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126" id="link126"></a>Mr. White
      makes no reservation of "gossiping tradition" in the case of Robert
      Greene. Greene dies "on the fitting deathbed of a groveling debauchee,"
      because he was jealous of William Shakespeare, and was so injudicious, and
      so far forgot himself as to call that "jack of all trades" an "upstart
      crowe, beautified with our feathers," etc. It seems that poor Robert
      Greene's dying words&mdash;if they were his dying words&mdash;were his
      ante-mortem legacy of warning and prophecy to the ages which were to
      follow him. But they have not been heeded. His "upstart crowe" has not
      only kept all his borrowed feathers, but is arrayed each passing day with
      somebody's richer and brighter plumage. If Robert Greene could speak from
      the dust, he doubtless could tell us&mdash;as Jonson and the rest might
      have told us in their lifetimes, if they only would&mdash;whose all this
      plumage really was and is. But all are dust and ashes together now&mdash;dust
      and ashes three centuries old&mdash;and, as Miss Bacon said, "Who loses
      any thing that does not find" the secret of that dust? However, not a
      Shakespearean stops to waste a sigh over the memory of poor Robert Greene,
      * who saw his bread snatched from his mouth by a scissorer of other men's
      brains, and who was too human to see
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "Robert Greene was a clergyman, and with no less poetry
     or rhetoric than his fellows (Nash, Peele, and William
     Shakespeare), was, from his miscellaneous and discursive
     reading, a very useful man in his coterie." Dr. Latham
     speaks of his book as "A Groats Worth of Rest, purchased
     with a Million of Repentance," which certainly makes better
     sense than "a groat's worth of wit," etc., as usually
     written. Which is right? Greene died in 1592.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>and
      hold his peace; but over the drunken grave of the Stratford pretender&mdash;who
      was vanquished in his cups at Bidford and Pebworth, and lay all night
      under the thorn-tree, but who died bravely in them at the last&mdash;they
      weep as for one cut off untimely, as Dame Quickly over the lazared and
      lecherous clay of Sir John Falstaff: "Nay, sure, he's in Arthur's bosom,
      if ever a man went to Arthur's bosom.'A made a finer end, and went away an
      it had been any Christom child." But let us not assume the appearance of
      unkindness to William Shakespeare. He lived a merry life; and, so far as
      we can know, wronged nobody except his own wife, poor Robert Greene, and
      perhaps the delinquent for malt delivered. He loved his own, but that is
      no wrong. And, we must not forget that, so far as the world can ever know,
      he claimed not as his, save by his silence, the works a too flattering
      posterity has assigned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal to history not only declines to set aside, but affirms, with
      costs, the verdict rendered upon the evidence. And the sum is briefly
      this: If William Shakespeare wrote the plays, it was a miracle; every
      thing else being equal, the presumption is against a miracle; but, here,
      every thing else is not equal, for all the facts of history are
      reconcilable with history and irreconcilable with the miracle; if history
      is history, then miracle there was none&mdash;in other words, if there
      were one miracle, then there must have been two. If there had lived no
      such man as William Shakespeare, that "William Shakespeare" would be as
      good a name as any other to designate the authorship of the Shakespearean
      page, who will consider it worth while to <span class="pagenum">128</span><a

      This is all there is of Jonson's labored verses, of which very few
      Shakespeareans care to quote more than isolated passages of a line or two
      each. But taking them either as a whole (with their involved metaphors and
      most execrable and inapposite pun about Shakespeare's lines "shaking a
      lance at Ignorance")&mdash;or in spots (whichever spots the Shakespeareans
      prefer), what sort of historical proof does this poem afford? What sort of
      testimony is this as to a fact? Is it the sort we accept in our own
      personal affairs&mdash;in our business&mdash;in our courts of justice&mdash;in
      matters in which we have any thing at stake, or any living interest? Will
      any insurance company pay its risk on the ship Dolphin, on being
      furnished, by the Dolphin's owners, with a thrilling poem by Mr. Tennyson
      or Mr. Tup-per, describing the dreadful shipwreck of the Dolphin, the
      thunderous tempest in which she went down&mdash;the sky-capping waves,
      rent sails, creaking cordage, etc., etc.? Will any jury of twelve men hang
      a thirteenth man for murder on production, by the State, of a harrowing
      copy of verses, dwelling on midnight assassina<span class="pagenum">132</span><a
      name="link132" id="link132"></a>tion, stealthy stabs, shrieking victims,
      inconsolable widows, orphans, and the like? And shall we require less or
      more proof, in proportion as the fact to be proved is nearer or more
      remote?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, since the Shakespeareans rest their case on these verses, (for
      any one who cares to examine for himself will find the residue of the
      so-called "contemporary testimony," which is usually in rhyme, to be
      rather criticism&mdash;that is to say <i>eulogy</i>, for we find very
      little of any other sort of literary criticism in those days&mdash;as to
      the compositions than chronicle as to the man) we can well afford to waive
      these questions, and cross-examine Ben Jonson and his verses without
      pressing any objection to their competency.
    </p>
    <p>
      For criticism of the works is what Meres's * opinion that "the sweete
      wittie soul of Ovid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare;
      witness his "Venus and Adonis," his "Lucrece," his sugared sonnets among
      his private friends...." As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for
      comedy and tragedy among the Latines, so Shakespeare among the English is
      the most excellent in both kinds for the stage....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "Palladis Tamia."
</pre>
    <p>
      As Epius Stoio said that the Muses would speake with Plautus' tongue, if
      they would speake Latin, so I say that the Muses would speake with
      Shakespeare's fine-filed phrase, if they would speake English, etc., etc.,
      etc., amount to; and so Weever's
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Honey-tongued Shakespeare, when I saw thine issue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I swore Apollo got them, and none other"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      probably means, if it means any thing, precisely what it says, namely,
      that when he read the plays, he swore <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>that they were certainly Apollo's. And if
      the comments of Henry Chettle, Sir John Davies, Leonard Digges, Hugh
      Holland, and the rest, do not read to the same effect, they have a meaning
      beyond what they express. But panegyric is not history&mdash;at least it
      can not override history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the affirmative theory of the Stratfordian authorship, then, and
      the demonstration of its utter impossibility and absurdity, there actually
      remains but the single barrier of the Jonsonian testimony, contained in
      the copy of verses entitled "To the Memory of my Beloved, the Author, Mr.
      William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us," written by Mr. Ben
      Jon-son, and prefixed to the famous folio of 1623. If this testimony
      should ever be ruled out as incompetent, there would actually remain
      nothing except to lay the Shakespearean hoax away, as gently as might be,
      alongside its fellows in the populous limbo of exploded fallacies.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, let it not be ruled out merely on the ground that it is in rhyme.
      We have no less an authority than Littleton&mdash;"auetoritas
      philosopho-rum, medieorum et poetarum sunt in causis allegan-d√¶ et
      tenend√¶" *&mdash;to the effect that the testimony, even of poets, is
      sometimes to be received. It is to be ruled out rather by a process akin
      to impeachment of the witness&mdash;by its appearing that the witness,
      elsewhere in the same controversy, testifies to a state of facts exactly
      opposite. For the truth is that, whatever Ben Jonson felt moved to say
      about his "pal" William Shakespeare, whenever, "as a friend, he <span
      class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>dropped into
      poetry," he was considerably more careful when he sat himself down to
      write "cold prose."
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as "Bully Bottom," fearing lest a lion should "fright the ladies,"
      and "hang every mother's son" of his troupe, devised a prologue to explain
      that the lion was no lion, but only Snug the Joiner, "a man as other men
      are," so Master Ben Jonson, however tropical and effusive as to his
      contemporary in his prosody, in his prologue in <i>prose</i> was
      scrupulous to leave only the truth behind him. Mountains&mdash;Ossian
      piled on Pelion&mdash;of hearsay and lapse of time; oceans of mere opinion
      and "gush" would, of course, amount to precisely nothing at all when
      ranged alongside of the testimony of one single, competent, contemporary
      eye-witness. No wonder the Shakespeareans are eager to subpoena Ben
      Jonson's verses. But, all the same, they are marvelously careful <i>not</i>
      to subpoena his prose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this prose is extant, and by no means inaccessible. Malien Jonson
      died, in 1637, he left behind him certain memoranda which were published
      in 1640, and are well-known as "Ben Jonson's Discoveries." One of these
      memoranda&mdash;for the work is in the disjointed form of a common-place
      book of occasional entries&mdash;is devoted to the eminent men of letters
      in the era spanned by its author's own acquaintance or familiarity. It
      runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cicero is said to be the only wit that the people of Rome had equaled
      to their empire. Imperium par imperio. We have had many, and in their
      several ages (to take in the former s√¶culum), Sir Thomas More, the elder
      Wiat, Henry, Earl of Surry, Chal-oner, Smith, Eliot, B. Gardiner, were,
      for their times, admirable; and the more because they began eloquence with
      us. Sir Nich<span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135" id="link135"></a>olas
      Bacon was singular and almost alone in the beginning of Elizabeth's time.
      Sir Philip Sidney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew great masters
      of wit and language, and in whom all vigour of invention and strength of
      judgment met. The Earl of Essex, noble and high, and Sir Walter Raleigh
      not to be contemned, either for judgment or style. Sir Henry Saville,
      grave and truly lettered. Sir Edwin Sandys, excellent in both. Lord
      Egerton, a grave and great orator, and best when he was provoked. But his
      learned and able, but unfortunate successor, is he that hath filled up all
      numbers, and performed that in our tongue which may be compared or
      preferred either to insolent Greece or haughty Rome. * In short, within
      this view, and about this time, were all the wits born that could honour a
      language or help study. Now things daily fall; wits grow downward and
      eloquence grows backward. So that he may be so named and stand as the mark

     * Judge Holmes ("Authorship of Shakespeare," third edition,
     p. 650) italicises these words to point the allusion to
     Bacon, and to notice that the passage in "The Discoveries,"
     immediately preceding the above, is a direct allusion to
     Bacon, while the phrase "insolent Greece and haughty
     Rome" occurs in line thirty-nine of the verses eulogistic of
     William Shakespeare.

      Only fourteen years before, this Ben Jonson had published the verses which
      <i>made</i> William Shakespeare. Only fourteen years before he had
      asserted&mdash;what the world has taken his word for, and never questioned
      from that day to this&mdash;that his "best beloved" William Shakespeare
      had been the "soul of the age"&mdash;"not for an age, but for all time"&mdash;and
      his works "such as neither man nor muse can praise too much!" We have no
      means of knowing the precise date at which Ben Jonson's grief for his dead
      friend cooled, <span class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136"
      id="link136"></a>and his feelings experienced a change. But he leaves
      behind him, at his death, this unembellished memoranda, this catalogue "of
      all the wits" living in his day, who, in his opinion, "could honour a
      language or help study," and in this catalogue he inserts no such name as
      William Shakespeare; William Shakespeare, the name&mdash;not only of the
      "soul" and epitome of all that&mdash;only, about fourteen years ago&mdash;he
      had deemed worth mentioning among men "born about this time;" but of his
      late most intimate and bosom friend! Had the "Discoveries" preserved an
      absolute silence concerning William Shakespeare, the passage we have
      quoted might, perhaps, have been considered a studied and deliberate slur
      on his dead friend's memory, on the part of Jonson, made for reasons best
      known to Jon-son himself. But they are not silent. They devote a whole
      paragraph to William Shakespeare&mdash;but in the proper place; that is to
      say, not among "the wits who could honour a language or help study," but
      among the author's personal acquaintance. This is all there is of this
      paragraph as to the real William Shakespeare:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to
      Shakespeare, that in his writing (whatever he penned) he never blotted out
      a line. My answer hath been, "would he had blotted out a thousand!" which
      they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for
      their ignorance, who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by,
      wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine own candour (for I loved the
      man, and do honour his memory on this side idolatry, as much as any). He
      was (indeed) honest and of an open and free nature; had an excellent
      phantasie, brave notions, and gentle expressions: wherein he flowed with
      that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped.
      Sufflaminan<span class="pagenum">137</span><a name="link137" id="link137"></a>dus
      erat, as Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his own power, would
      that the rule of it had been so too! Many times he fell into those things
      could not escape laughter; as when he said in the person of C√¶sar&mdash;one
      speaking to him&mdash;"C√¶sar, thou dost me wrong;" he replied, "C√¶sar
      never did wrong, but with just cause," and such like; which were
      ridiculous. But he redeemed his vices with his virtues. There was ever
      more in him to be praised than pardoned.</i> *
    </p>
    <p>
      That is every word which a man who "loved him" could say of William
      Shakespeare!&mdash;that he was a skilled and careful penman, "never
      blotting out a line;" that he talked too fast, sometimes, and had to be
      checked; that, in playing the part of C√¶sar on the stage, somebody
      interpolated the speech, "C√¶sar, thou dost me wrong," and he made a bull
      in response; ** and that he (Jonson) wished he (Shakespeare) had blotted
      out a thousand of his lines. Blot out a thousand Shakespearean lines!&mdash;a
      thousand of the priceless lines of the peerless book we call
      "Shakespeare!"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *   "Works," cited ante, vol. vii., p. 91.

     **  Possibly this may have occurred in playing the very
     version of the "C√¶sar" we now possess, though there are, of
     course, no such lines to be found there.

    <p>
      Fancy the storm which would follow such a vandal proposition to-day! Ben
      Jonson does not specify <i>which</i> thousand he would have expurgated,
      but would be satisfied with any thousand, taken anywhere at random out of
      the writings of his "soul of the age," the man "not of an age, but for all
      time!" And yet it is on the uncorroborated word of this man Jonson that we
      build monuments to the Stratford lad, and make pilgrimages to his
      birthplace and worship his ashes, and quarrel about the spelling of his
      name! If there is not a <span class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138"
      id="link138"></a>strong smack of patronage in this prose allusion to
      Shakespeare, we confess ourselves unable to detect its flavor. Very
      possibly the fact was that, so far from having been an admirer of William
      Shakespeare, Ben Jonson saw through his pretensions, and only through
      policy sang his praises against the stomach of his sense. For Ben Jonson,
      though one of the ripest scholars of the day (we have history as authority
      for that), was poor and a borrower, over head and ears in debt to
      Shakespeare; he was a stock actor on the rich managers boards, and could
      not take the bread out of his own mouth. But the poor scholar, and still
      poorer actor, could yet indulge himself, and take his covert fling at the
      rich charlatan:

      Again, in the "Induction" to his "Bartholomew <span class="pagenum">139</span><a

      "If there be never a servant-monster in the fair, who can help it," he
      says, "nor a nest of antiques? He is loth to make Nature afraid in his
      plays, like those that beget tales, tempests, and such like drolleries." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "The Tempest" of that day in William Shakespeare's hands,
     then, was a "drollery." See some curious evidence going to
     prove that, while the titles of the plays always remain the
     same, the plays themselves may have been different at
     different times. 'post VI, "The New Theory." Dr. Carl Elze
     (Essays on Shakespeare. London. Macmillans. 1874), thinks
     that Jonson meant a hit at Shakespeare when he says, in
     Volpone, "all our English authors will steal."
</pre>
    <p>
      But that Jonson never himself believed, or expressed himself as believing,
      that William Shakespeare was a poet (except in this rhymed panegyric which
      Heminges and Condell prefixed to the first folio), there is still further
      and perhaps stronger proof. Three years after William Shakespeare's death,
      Ben Jonson paid a visit to William Drummond of Hawthornden, and spent with
      him the greater part of the month of April, 1019 (or, as some fix it, the
      month of January, in that year). Drummond was a poet himself, and, it is
      said, his poetical reputation was what had attracted Jonson to make the
      visit. At any rate, he did visit him, and Drummond kept notes of Jonson's
      conversation. These notes are in the form of entries or items, grouped
      under Drummond's own headings or titles, such as: "his acquaintance and
      behavior with poets living with him."

      There are, in all, between two and three hundred entries of a similar
      character. Now, in one of these entries, Jonson is represented as saying
      that he "esteemeth Done the first poet in the world in some things;" but
      there is nothing put in Jonson's month, in the whole category, about the

      Drummond's works in 1711. These notes were believed by Sir Walter Scott to
      be genuine, and, by his advice, were printed first in the "Archaeological
      Scotica," in or about 1723. At any rate, they were never printed by
      Sibbald himself, nor used by him in any way which suggested a motive for
      forgery, and, internally, they agree with Ben Jonson's own "Discoveries,"
      especially as to his (Jonson's) estimate of William Shakespeare.

      And yet Ben Johnson was the beneficiary and friend of William Shakespeare&mdash;the
      "immortal Shakespeare"&mdash;whom Ben "honours <i>this side</i> idolatry,"
      but whom we are not fearful of passing the bounds of idolatry in
      worshiping to-day. Ben Johnson was an overworked rhymester, and made his
      rhymes do double and treble duty. The first couplet of the prologue just

      of the mortuary verses which&mdash;as we say&mdash;made Shakespeare
      Shakespeare. When the rich manager's alleged works were to be collected,
      the poor scholar, who had borrowed money of him in his lifetime, was
      called upon for a tribute. But the poor scholar for<span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>bore to draw on the storehouse of his
      wits, though willing: to hammer over some of his old verses for the
      occasion. He once assured posterity, in rhyme, that they must not "give
      nature all," but remember his gentle Shakespeare's art, how he would
      "sweat and strike the second heat upon the muse's anvil" (in other words,
      bring by long toil the firstlings of his genius to artificial perfection).
      And yet he deliberately tells Drummond, long years after, and puts it down
      in black and white over his own. signature, that this same Shakespeare
      "wanted art," and that the great trouble with him was that he talked too
      much. Is it possible that the ideal Shakespeare, the mighty
      miracle-working demigod, is only the accidental creation of a man who was
      poking fun at a shadow? Let us not proceed to such a violent surmise, but
      return to a serious consideration of Mr. Ben Jonson's unimpassioned prose.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the paragraph from the "Discoveries" last above quoted&mdash;which
      estimates William Shakespeare precisely as history estimates him, namely,
      as a clever fellow, and a player in one of the earliest theaters in London&mdash;is
      not to be regarded as a confession that Ben Jonson's verses were written
      (or rewritten) more out of generosity to his late friend's memory&mdash;rather
      in the exuberance of a poetic license of apotheosis&mdash;than with a
      literal adherence to truth;* then it must be conceded that the result is
      such a facing both ways as <span class="pagenum">143</span><a
      name="link143" id="link143"></a>hangs any Jonsonian testimony in perfect
      equilibrium as to the Shakespearean controversy, and entitles Ben Jonson
      himself, as a witness for anybody or to any thing, to simply step down and
      out.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A confession, say the Baconians, that Jonson, as long as
     Bacon lived, was eager to serve him by shouldering on his
     incognito&mdash;in poetry&mdash;while he was under no compunction to
     do so in his own posthumous remains. See post V, The
     Baconian Theory.
</pre>
    <p>
      For, admitting that his poetry is just as good as his prose&mdash;and
      probably the Shakespeareans would care to assert no more than that&mdash;it
      is a legal maxim that a witness who swears for both sides swears for
      neither; and a rule of common law no less than of common sense that his
      evidence must be ruled out, since no jury can be called upon to believe
      and disbelieve one and the same witness at the same time. And so we are
      relieved from accounting for the "Jonson testimony," as did Lord
      Palmerston, by saying: "O, those fellows always hang together; or, its
      just possible Jonson may have been deceived like the rest;" * or by asking
      ourselves if a score of rhymes by Ben Johnson, a fellow craftsman (not
      sworn to, of course, and not nearly as tropical or ecstatic as they might
      have been, and yet been quite justifiable under the rule nil nisi)&mdash;are
      to outweigh all historic certainty? If Jonson had written a life, or
      memoir, or "recollections," or "table-talk," of William Shakespeare, it
      might have been different. But he only gives us a few cheap lines of
      poetical eulogy; and fact is one thing, and poetry&mdash;unless there is
      an exception in this instance&mdash;is conceded to be altogether another.

      But since numberless good people are suspicious of rules of law as applied
      to evidence, regarding them as over-nice, finical, and as framed rather to
      keep out truth than to let it in, let-us waive the legal maxim, <span
      class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>and admit the
      Jonsonian testimony to be one single, consistent block of contemporary
      evidence. But, no sooner do we do this, than we find ourselves straightway
      floundering in a slough of absurdities for greater, it seems to us, than
      any we have yet encountered. To illustrate: It is necessary to the
      Shakespearean theory that in the days of Elizabeth and James there should
      have been not only a <i>man</i>, but a genius, a wit, and a poet, of the
      name of William Shakespeare; and that all these&mdash;man, genius, wit,
      and poet&mdash;should have been one and the same individual. Taking all
      the Jonsonian testimony, prose and poetry, together, such an individual
      there was, and his name was William Shakespeare, as required. But&mdash;still
      following Jonson's authority&mdash;at the same period and in the same town
      of London there was a certain gentleman named Bacon, who was "learned and
      able," and who had, moreover, "filled up all numbers&mdash;and" in the
      same days "performed that which may be compared either to insolent Greece
      or haughty Rome." We have, then, not only a "wit and poet" named
      Shakespeare, but a "wit and poet" named Bacon; and, since Jonson is
      nowhere too modest to admit that he himself was a "wit and poet," we have,
      therefore, actually not one but three of a kind, at each other's elbows in
      London, in the golden age of English literature. We have already seen
      that, of this trio, two&mdash;Bacon and Shakespeare, if we are to believe
      the Shakespeareans&mdash;were personally unknown to each other. It is
      worth our while to pause right here, and see what this statement involves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are all three&mdash;Bacon, Jonson, and Shakespeare&mdash;dwelling in
      the same town at the same mo<span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a>ment; are, all three, writers and wits,
      earning their living by their pens. Ben Jonson is the mutual friend. He is
      of service to both&mdash;he translates Bacon's English into Latin for him,
      * and writes plays for William Shakespeare's stage, and, as we have seen,
      he ultimately becomes the Boswell of both, and runs from one to the other
      in rapture.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Jonson assisted Dr. Hackett, afterward Bishop of
     Litchfield and Coventry, in translating the essays of Lord
     Bacon into Latin. (Whalley, "Life of Ben Jonson," Vol. I. of

      His admiration for Bacon, on the one hand (according to his prose),
      amounts to a passion; his admiration for Shakespeare, on the other hand
      (according to his poetry), amounts to a passion, he declares (in prose)
      that Bacon "hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in our tongue,
      which may be compared and preferred either to <i>insolent Greece or

      And yet he never, while going from one to the other, mentions Shakespeare
      to Bacon or Bacon to Shakespeare; never "introduces" them or brings them
      together; never gives his soul's idol Bacon any "order" to his soul's idol
      Shakespeare's theater, that this absolutely inimitable Bacon (who has
      surpassed insolent Greece and haughty Rome) may witness the masterpieces
      of this absolutely inimitable Shakespeare<span class="pagenum">146</span><a

      Greece and haughty Rome); this Boswell of a Jonson, go-between of two men

      praises of each to the world outside (using the same figures of speech for
      each), and, in the presence of each, preserves so impenetrable a silence
      as to the other, that of the two public characters themselves each is
      absolutely ignorant of the other's existence! And yet they ought to have
      been close friends, for they borrowed each other's verses, and loaned each
      other paragraphs to any extent. Persons there have been who asserted, as
      we shall see, on merely the internal evidence of their writings, that
      Bacon and "Shakespeare" were one and the same man, and that what appeared
      to be "parallelisms" and coincidences in Bacon and "Shakespeare" were thus
      to be accounted for. But, admitting their separate identity, it is certain
      either that the natural philosopher borrowed his exact facts from the
      comedies of the playwright, or that the playwright borrowed the speeches
      for his comedies from the natural philosopher; either of which looks very
      much like, at least, a speaking acquaintance. For, as we shall see further
      on, * some of these "parallelisms" are not coincidences, but something
      very like <i>identities</i>.

      It will not lighten this new difficulty to rule out the prose and leave in
      the poetry, for we can not annihilate Francis Bacon nor yet William
      Shakespeare from their places in history. If, however, the Jonsonian
      poetry <i>were</i> wiped out, the Jonsonian prose would receive, at least,
      a negative corroboration, as follows: <span class="pagenum">147</span><a
      name="link147" id="link147"></a>At the same time that Bacon and
      Shakespeare are living, unknown to each other respectively, in London,
      there also dwell there three other gentlemen&mdash;Sir Walter Raleigh,
      Edmund Spenser, and Sir Tobie Matthew. We, therefore, actually have four
      well-known gentlemen of the day in London, gentlemen of elegant tastes&mdash;poets,
      men about town, critics&mdash;who, if the town were being convulsed by the
      production at a theater of by far the most brilliant miracles of genius
      that the world had ever seen, ought not, in the nature of things, to have
      been utterly uninformed as to the circumstance. We do not add to this list
      Southampton, Essex, Rutland, Montgomery, and the rest, because these
      latter have left no memorandum or chronicle of what they saw and heard on
      manuscript behind them. But the first four have left just precisely such
      memoranda of their times as are of assistance to us here. Bacon, in his
      "Apothegms," Spenser in his poems, * and Raleigh and Matthew in their re<span
      class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>mains&mdash;especially
      Matthew&mdash;who, like Bacon, kept a diary, who wrote letters and
      postscripts, and was as fond of playing at Boswell to his favorites as
      Jonson himself&mdash;appear to have stumbled on no trace of such a
      character as "Shakespeare" in all their sauntering about London.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Spenser's well-known lines in "Colin Clout's come Home
     again," written in 1591, are:

     And there, though last not least, is √Ütion,

     A gentler shepherd may nowhere be found,

     Whose muse, full of high thought's invention,

     Doth&mdash;life himself&mdash;heroically sound."

     "√Üton" is generally assumed by commentators to stand in the
     verse for "Shakespeare." But it is difficult to imagine how
     this can possibly be more than mere speculation, since
     Spenser certainly left no annotation explanatory of the
     passage, and it does not identify itself as a reference to
     Shakespeare. In "The Tears of the Muses," line 205, there is
     an allusion which on a first glance appears so pat, that the
     Bard of Avon has long been called "our pleasant Willy" on
     the strength of it. It runs:

     "And ho, the man whom Nature's self had made, To mock
     herself and truth to imitate

     With kindly counter under mimick shade,

     Our pleasant Willy, ah, is dead of late:

     With whom all joy and jolly merriment Is also deaded, and in
     dolour dreut."

     But, since Spenser died some seventeen years before
     Shakespeare, and if&mdash;as must be supposed from their
     flippancy&mdash;these lines point to the enforced or voluntary
     retirement or silence of some writer, rather than to his
     death&mdash;they appear more nearly to refer to Sidney than to
     Shakespeare. And this now appears to be conceded. (See
     Morley's "English Men of Letters: Spenser," by Dean Church.
     American edition, Harpers, New York, 1879, p. 106.) Besides,
     "The Tears of the Muses" was written in 1580, when
     Shakespeare was a lad of sixteen, holding horses at the
     theater door. "Will," or "WiB," appears to have been the
     ordinary nickname of a poet in those days.&mdash;R. Gr. White's
     "Shakespeare," vol. i., p. 57, note.
</pre>
    <p>
      Especially on one occasion does Sir Tobie devote himself to a
      subject-matter wherein, if there had been any "Shakespeare" within his
      ken, he could very properly&mdash;and would, we think, very naturally&mdash;have
      mentioned him. In the "Address to the Reader," prefixed to one of his
      works, * he says, speaking of his own date, "We have also rare
      compositions made among us which look so many fair ways at once that I
      doubt it will go near to pose any other nations of Europe to muster out in
      any age four men who, in so many respects, should be able to excel <span

      we are able to show&mdash;Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More, Sir Philip

      Besides, these four&mdash;or, dismissing Spenser, who was a poet
      exclusively&mdash;then three, Bacon, Raleigh, and Tobie Matthew&mdash;however
      else dissimilar, were any thing but blockheads or anchorites. They were
      men of the court and of the world. They mingled among their fellow-men,
      and (by a coincidence which is very useful to us here) none of them were
      silent as to what they met and saw during their careers. They both live
      and move in the very town and in the very days when this rare poetry which
      Emerson says "the greatest minds value most" was appearing. But, if
      William Shakespeare was the author of it all, how is it possible to escape
      the conviction that not one of them all&mdash;not Bacon, a man of letters
      himself, a student of antique not only, but of living and contemporary
      literature, and overfond of writing down his impressions for the benefit
      of posterity (even if wanting in the dramatic or poetic perception, the
      scholarship of the plays could not have escaped him; and had these plays
      been the delight and town talk of all London, as Mr. Grant White says they
      were, some morsel of them must have reached his ear or eye)&mdash;not
      Raleigh, courtier, gallant, man-about-town, "curled darling," and every
      thing of that sort (who probably was not afraid to go to a theater for
      fear of injuring his morals)&mdash;not Tobie Matthew, who was all this
      latter with less of responsibility and mental balance&mdash;ever so much
      as heard his (Shakespeare's) name mentioned? That not one of these ever
      heard of a name that was in every<span class="pagenum">150</span><a
      name="link150" id="link150"></a>body's mouth&mdash;of a living man so
      famous that, as we shall presently consider, booksellers were using his
      name to make their wares sell, that his plays were fill-ins: the most
      fashionable theater in London from cockpit to the dome; whose popularity
      was so exalted that the great Queen Elizabeth herself stepped down from
      the throne and walked across his stage to do him honor, to whom in after
      days, her successor King was to write an autograph letter (for these must
      all be considered in the argument, though, as we have seen, the King James
      story is only one of the "yarns," * cooked for occasion by commentators,
      or the growth of rumor&mdash;in orthodox procession from "might have been"
      to "was"&mdash;and so, doubtless, is the other) is a trifle incredible to
      a mind not already adjusted to swallow any and every fable in this
      connection rather than accept the truth of history! To be sure, it is not
      absolutely impossible that these three men should have been cognizant of
      William Shakespeare's existence without mentioning him in their favors to
      posterity.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The story of Elizabeth's order for "Falstaff in Love,"
     resulting in the production of "The Merry Wives of Windsor"
     (which would prove that, whatever else she was, Elizabeth
     was no Anthony Comstock), is, to our mind, another sample of
     the same procession. Hazlitt (Lit. of Europe, Part iii.,
     chap. 6, sec. iii., note,) is especially incredulous as to
     the King James letter. The truth is that Shakespeare, far
     from being flattered by James, was actually in disgrace, and
     not so much as to be mentioned in that monarch's hearing,
     from having permitted a representation of the sacred person
     of royalty on his stage, as is authenticated by the well-
     known lines of Davies:

     "Hadst thou not played some Kingly parts in sport, etc., etc."
</pre>
    <p>
      But, under all the circumstances, it is vastly improbable. At any rate, we
      fancy it would not be easy to conceive of <span class="pagenum">151</span><a
      name="link151" id="link151"></a>three Englishmen in London to-day, in 1881&mdash;let
      us say Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Browning, and Mr. Swinburne&mdash;without
      collusion, writing down a list of their most illustrious contemporaries,
      and not one of them mentioning Mr. Tennyson! Or, assuming that Tennyson is
      the admitted first of poets of the Victorian age (as Mr. Ben Jonson and
      all the commentators at his heels, down to our own Mr. Grant White, tell
      us that "William Shakespeare" was the admitted first of poets of his
      contemporary Elizabethan age), it would not be the easiest thing in the
      world to conceive three chroniclers&mdash;Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Browning, and
      Mr. Swinburne-sitting themselves down to an enumeration, not of their
      illustrious contemporaries in general, but of their contemporaneous men of
      letters only, and, by a coincidence, omitting any mention of the great
      first of poets of their day! Either, then, it seems to us we are to infer
      that three such men as Raleigh, Bacon, (who, Emerson says, "took the
      inventory of the human understanding, for his time,") and his satellite
      Matthew, had never so much as heard that there was any Shakespeare, in an
      age which we moderns worship as the age of Shakespeare, or that there was
      no "Shakespeare" for them to hear about; that "William Shakespeare" was
      the name of an actor and manager in the Globe and Blackfriars play-houses,
      of a man not entitled, any more than any of his co-actors and co-managers
      in those establishments, to enumeration among the illustrious ornaments of
      an illustrious age, the stars of the golden age of English!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it can be well urged that all this is mere negative evidence;
      that not only three but three million of men might be found who had never
      mentioned <span class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>or
      ever heard of Shakespeare, without affecting the controversy either way.
      But, under the circumstances, in view of what the Shakespearean plays <i>are</i>,
      and of what their author must have been, and of when and where these three
      men&mdash;Bacon, Raleigh, and Matthew&mdash;lived and flourished, the
      chronicles left by these three men&mdash;Bacon, Raleigh, and Matthew&mdash;constitute,
      at the very least, a "negative pregnant" not to be omitted in any review
      of our controversy that can lay the faintest claim to exhaustiveness or
      sincerity; and, moreover, a negative pregnant which&mdash;if we admitted
      all the Ben Jonson testimony, in prose and poetry, as evidence on the one
      side&mdash;could not be excluded as evidence on the other. In which event
      it is fairest to the Shakespeareans to rule Ben out altogether. **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  And we might add to these Sir John Davies, Selden, Sir
     John Beaumont, Henry Vaughn, Lord Clarendon and others.

     **  It is fair to note that another "negative pregnant"
     arises here, to which the Shakespeareans are as fairly
     entitled as the other side to theirs. Sir Tobie Matthew died
     in 1655. He survived Shakespeare thirty-nine years, Bacon
     twenty-nine years, and Raleigh thirty-seven years! Left in
     possession of the secret of the Baconian authorship, how
     could such a one as Matthew let the secret die with him?
     Although we do not meet with it among the arguments of the
     Shakespeareans, this strikes us as about the strongest they
     could present, except that the answer might be that at the
     date of Matthew's death, 1655, the Shakespearean plays were
     not held in much repute, or that Matthew might have reserved
     his unbosoming of the secret too long; but it is only one
     fact among a thousand.
</pre>
    <p>
      Besides, Ben is what the Scotchmen call "a famous witness" (if the
      commentators, who enlarge on Shakespeare's bounty and loans to him, can be
      relied upon), as being under heavy pecuniary obligation to the stage
      manager, and so his testimony is to be scrutinized with the <span
      class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153" id="link153"></a>greatest
      care, though he certainly did not allow his obligations to over-master him
      when writing the "Discoveries." But, in any event, it would be easier to
      believe that Ben Jonson once contradicted himself for the sake of a rhyme,
      and to "do the handsome thing" by the memory of an old friend and unpaid
      creditor, than to swallow the incredible results of a literal version of
      his prose and poetry, read by the light of the Bacon, Raleigh, and Matthew
      remains. And the conclusion of the matter, it seems to us, must be: either
      that the poetry was the result of his obligations to William Shakespeare
      and to William Shakespeare's memory, or that, having sworn on both sides,
      Mr. Ben Jonson stands simply dehors the case&mdash;a witness for neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, then&mdash;it is very far from being&mdash;because we know so
      little of the man Shakespeare that we disbelieve in his authorship of the
      great works ascribed to him. It is because we know so much. No sooner did
      men open their histories, turn up the records and explore the traditions
      and trace the gossip of' the Elizabethan days, than the facts stared them
      in the face. Long before any "Baconian theory" arose to account for these
      anomalies: at the instant these plays began to be valued for any thing
      else than their theatrical properties, the difficulty of "marrying the man
      to his verse" began to be troublesome. "To be told that he played a trick
      on a brother actor in a licentious amour, or that he died of a drunken
      frolic, does not exactly inform us of the man who wrote 'Lear,'" cried Mr.
      Hallam. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "I laud," says Hallam, "the labors of Mr. Collier, Mr.
     Hunter, and other collectors of such crumbs, though I am not
     sure that we should not venerate Shakespeare as much if they
     had left him undisturbed in his obscurity.... If there was a
     Shakespeare of earth, as I suspect, there was also one of
     heaven, and it is of him we desire to know something."

      "Every accession of in <span class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154"
      id="link154"></a>formation we obtain respecting the man Shakespeare
      renders it more and more difficult to detect in him the poet," cries Mr.
      William Henry Smith. * "I am one of the many," testifies Mr. Furness, "who
      have never been able to bring the life of William Shakespeare and the
      plays of Shakespeare within a planetary space of each other; are there any
      other two things in the world more incongruous?" **

    <p>
      It was necessary, therefore, in order to preserve a belief in the
      Shakespearean authorship, either that William Shakespeare should be
      historically known as a man of great mental power, a close student of deep
      insight into nature and morals&mdash;a poet, philosopher, and all the rest&mdash;or
      else that, by a failure of the records, history should be silent
      altogether as to his individuality, and the lapse of time have made it
      impossible to recover any details whatever as to his tastes, manners, and
      habits of life. In such a case, of course, there would remain no evidence
      on the subject other than that of the plays themselves, which would, of
      course, prove him precisely the myriad-minded genius required. In other
      words, it was only necessary to so cloud over <i>the facts</i> as to make
      the "Shakespearean miracle" to be, <i>not</i> that William Shakespeare had
      written the works, but&mdash;that history should be so silent concerning a
      "Shakespeare!" So long as the Shakespeareans could cry, "Behold a mys<span
      class="pagenum">155</span><a name="link155" id="link155"></a>terious
      dispensation of Providence&mdash;that, of the two mightiest poets the
      world has ever held&mdash;Homer and William Shakespeare&mdash;we know
      absolutely nothing!"&mdash;so long as they could assign this silence to
      the havoc of a great deluge or a great fire, just so long the name
      "William Shakespeare" was as good and satisfactory a name as any other,
      and nobody could propose a better. But they can cry so no longer. It is
      not because we know so <i>little</i>, but because we know <i>so much</i>
      about the Stratford boy, that we decline to accept him as the master we
      not only admire and love, but in whose pages we find our wisdom vain and
      our discovery anticipated. As a matter of fact, through the accident of
      his having been a part-proprietor in one of the earliest English
      play-houses, we know pretty accurately what manner of man he was. We know
      almost every thing about him, in short, except&mdash;what we <i>do</i>
      know about Homer&mdash;that the words now attributed to him were <i>his</i>.
      Homer, at least, we can trace to his "Iliad" and his "Odyssey," as he sang
      them in fragments from town to town. But neither to his own pen nor his
      own lips, and only problematically (as we shall see further on) to his own
      stage, can we trace the plays so long assigned to William Shakespeare. Let
      the works be placed in our hands for the first time anonymously; given the
      chronicles of the age of Elizabeth and James in which to search for an
      author of these works, would any thing we found in either lead us to
      pronounce William Shakespeare their author? And has any thing happened <i>since</i>
      to induce us to set aside the record and substitute an act of pure faith,
      of faith blind and obedient, and make it almost a religion to blindly and
      obediently believe that William Shakes<span class="pagenum">156</span><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a>peare was not the man he was, lest we
      should be "disrespectful to our birthright?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing whatever has happened since, except the labors of the
      commentators. By the most painfully elaborate explorations on the wrong
      track, by ingenious postulation upon fictitious premises, and by divers
      illicit processes of majors and minors, while steering carefully clear of
      the records, they have evolved a butcher, a lawyer, a physician, a
      divinity student, a a schoolmaster, a candlestick-maker&mdash;but, after
      all, a Shakespeare. That the error, in the commencement, was the result of
      carelessness, there can be no doubt. But that, little by little&mdash;each
      commentator, either in rivalry for a new fact, and jealous to be one item
      ahead of his competitor (even if obliged to invent it out of hand), or
      being too indolent to examine for himself, or too subservient to authority
      to rebel&mdash;it grew to vast proportions, we have only to look at the
      huge "biographies" of the last half century to be assured. It will not
      detain us long, as an example of these, to briefly glance at the labors of
      one of the most intrepid of the ilk to identify the traditional poet with
      the traditional man. In 1839, Thomas De Quincy contributed to the
      "Encyclop√¶dia Britannica" its article "Shakespeare." That about the story
      of the prankish Stratford lad, who loved, and wooed and won a farmer's
      daughter, and between the low, smoky-raftered cottage in Stratford town
      and the snug little thatch at Shottery trudged every sunset to do his
      courting, there lingers the glamour of youth, and love, and poetry, no
      patron of the "Encyclop√¶dia" would probably have doubted. But that a staid
      and solemn work, designed for exact reference, should have printed <span
      class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>so whimsical
      a fancy sketch as Mr. De Quincy supplied to it, and that it should have
      been allowed to remain there, must certainly command surprise. There can
      surely be complaint as to the variety of the performance. Mr. De Quincy
      very ably and gravely speculates as to the size of the dowry old Hathaway
      gave his daughter; as to whether old John Shakespeare mortgaged his
      homestead to keep up appearances; and whether that gentleman received the
      patronage of Stratford corporation when (as there is no direct authority
      for saying they did not) they had occasion to present a pair of gloves to
      some favored nobleman (and this portion of the composition winds up with a
      history of gloves and glove-making which can not fail to interest and
      instruct the reader). And his speculations as to whether the messengers
      who sped to Worcester for the "marriage-lines" did or did not ride in such
      hot haste, in view of an expected but premature Susannah, that they gave
      vicious orthographies of the names "Shakspeare" and "Hathaway" to the aged
      clerk who drew the document, are, especially pretty reading. But&mdash;with
      facilities in 1839 for writing a history of the Stratford lad, which the
      Stratford lad's own contemporaries and near neighbors, two hundred years
      and more before Mr. De Quincy, seem never to have possessed&mdash;Mr. De
      Quincy quite surpasses himself in setting us exactly right as to William
      Shakespeare. And, first, as to the birthday. There has always been a sort
      of feeling among Englishmen that their greatest poet ought to have had no
      less a birthday than the day dedicated to their patron saint. The
      Stratford parish records certifying to the christening of William
      Shakespeare on the 26th day of April, <span class="pagenum">158</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a>1564 (which Mr. De Quincy forgets was "old
      style," and so, in any event, twelve days before the corresponding date in
      the present or "new style"), and the anniversary of St. George being fixed
      for celebration on the 23d of April, it had come to be unanimously
      resolved by the commentators that, in Warwickshire, it was the custom to
      christen infants on the third day after birth, and that, therefore,
      William Shakespeare was born on the anniversary of St. George, April 23,
      1564. To baptise a three-days-old baby, in an English April, a period five
      days earlier than, in the mild latitude of Palestine, the Israelites
      thought it necessary to circumcise their infants, seems a very un-English
      proceeding. So Mr. De Quincy, who would rather perish than mislead,
      thinks, after all, the birth might have been a day earlier. "After all,"
      he says, "William <i>might</i> have been born on the 22d. Only one
      argument," he gravely proceeds, "has sometimes struck us for supposing
      that the 22d might be the day, and not the 23d, which is, that
      Shakespeare's sole granddaughter, Lady Barnard, was married on the 22d of
      April, ten years exactly from the poet's death, and the reason for
      choosing this day might have had a reference to her illustrious
      grandfather's birthday, which, there is good reason for thinking, would be
      celebrated as a festival in the family for generations!" But even Mr. De
      Quincy appears to concede that, in writing history, we must draw the line
      somewhere; for he immediately adds, "Still this choice may have been an
      accident" (so many things, that is to say, are likely to be considered in
      fixing a marriage-day, besides one's grandfather's birthday!), "or
      governed merely by reason of convenience. And, <span class="pagenum">159</span><a
      name="link159" id="link159"></a>on the whole, it is as well, perhaps, to
      acquiesce in the old belief that Shakespeare was born and died on the 23d
      of April. We can not do wrong if we drink to his memory both on the 22d
      and 23d." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Mr. De Quincy's own estimate of this performance we take
     from a preface to the article itself, in the American
     edition of his collected works (Boston: Shepard &amp; Gill,
     1873), vol. xv., p. 11: "No paper ever cost me so much
     labor; parts of it have been recomposed three times over."
     And again, "William Shakespeare's article cost me more
     intense labor than any I ever wrote in my life and, I
     believe, if you will examine it, you will not complain of
     want of novelty." We should say not.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. De Quincy's proposition to drink twice instead of once ought to
      forever secure his popularity among Englishmen; but it remains,
      nevertheless, remarkable that a ponderous encyclopaedia should admit this
      sort of work among its articles on sugar, snakes, Sardinia, soap,
      Savonarola, and its other references in S! Like his fellow Shakespeareans,
      Mr. De Quincy makes no use of Aubrey, or the old clerk, or the Rev.
      Richard Davies, or any one else who, having lived at dates inconveniently
      contiguous to the real William Shakespeare, were awkward customers about
      whom it was best to say nothing. He cannot claim never to have heard of
      Aubrey, because he quotes him as saying that William Shakespeare was "a
      handsome, well-shaped man." But this is the only allusion he makes to
      Aubrey or to any body else who lived within eyesight or ear-shot of the
      William Shakespeare who (we admit), if a well-conducted person, <i>ought</i>
      reasonably to have been the man Mr. De Quincy and his ilk turn him out,
      and not the man his neighbors, or any body who happened to be born within
      a hundred years <span class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160"
      id="link160"></a>of him, knew him. As to the difficulties Coleridge,
      Goethe, Schlegel, Richter, Carlyle, Palmerston, Emerson, Gervinius,
      Hallam, Holmes, William Henry Smith, Furness, and Delia Bacon find so
      insurmountable&mdash;namely, as to where the material of the plays came
      from&mdash;Mr. De Quincy skips over these with his airy two terms at the
      little grammar-school on Stratford High Street! (The identical desk which
      William occupied during this period of attendance at that institution of
      learning was promptly supplied by the Stratford guides, upon hearing Mr.
      De Quincy's discovery.) "Old Aubrey," two hundred years nearer his
      subject, was careful to give his school-master's story "for what it was
      worth," admitting that his authority for the statement that William
      Shakespeare was a school-master was only a rumor, founded on the statement
      of one "Beeston;" but who was "Beeston?" Some of our modern commentators
      have conjectured that possibly William, being a sort of model or head boy,
      was trusted to hear some of the little boys' lessons, which gave rise to
      the "school-master" story. But Mr. De Quincy allows no demurrer nor doubt
      to his assertions in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. And for these "two
      terms" (of course), no further authority than himself being necessary, he
      vouchsafes none. Such dry things as references are gracefully compensated
      for by favoring the reader in search for Shakespearean data with two
      dissertations upon the loveliness of female virtue, one of which covers
      fourteen pages octavo. * His cue has had prolific fol<span class="pagenum">161</span><a

    </p>

     *  Of Sheppard &amp; Gill's reprint (pp. 41, 69-83). But if Mr.
     De Quincy could have lived until November, 1879, even he
     might have been taught something. The Rev. John Bayley, in
     an article on "The Religion of Shakespeare," in the "Sunday
     Magazine" (New York: Frank Leslie, November, 1879, p. 518),
     says of William Shakespeare,"

     "During the last years of his life it is stated that he and
     his family attended the parish church where the Rev. Richard
     Byfield, an eminent Puritan minister, and father of the
     distinguished commentator on the Epistle to the Colossians,
     commenced his ministry, a. d. 1606." Of course, the reverend
     contributor to the "Sunday Magazine" does not in-form us
     where this fact "is stated," but concludes from the fact (he
     is sure it is a fact) that Shakespeare was "during the last
     years of his life the constant hearer of this eminent and
     energetic preacher of the gospel," and that "we may
     reasonably hope for the best of consequences." So simple a
     process has Shakespeare-making become!
</pre>
    <p>
      Now-a-days our "biographies" of William Shakespeare are huge tomes of
      Elizabethan and other antiquarian lore, commentary, conjecture,
      argumentation; that stupefy us, as it were, by mere bulk and show of
      research, into accepting the whole rather than plunge into so vast and
      shoreless a sea of apparent labor, and, therefore, alleged learning. For
      such is the indolence of man, that the bulkier the book the less likely is
      it to be read or refuted. And so, in view of the great eye-filling books
      labeled "biographies" of William Shakespeare&mdash;volumes commensurate
      with the idea of a life which might, in time at least, have compassed the
      mighty works&mdash;one need not doubt that "William Shakespeare" was the
      name of the marvelous man who wrote the plays.
    </p>

      But, when one left the fiction of Mr. De Quincy and his ilk, and was
      forced to confront the William Shakespeare who wrote the Lucy lampoon and
      the epitaph on Elias James, who stuck calves and stole <span
      class="pagenum">162</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>deer, the
      difficulty only recurred with redoubled emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, of course, because William stuck the calves and stole the deer,
      because he wrote the lampoon or the epitaph, nor because he was son (or
      apprentice, as some lay), to a butcher or a glover, a tallow-chandler or a
      seedsman, that he is conceived to have been unequal to the Shakespearean
      authorship. There never yet was cradle too lowly to be the cradle of
      genius, or line too ignoble for its genesis. George Stephenson was a
      colliery-stoker, Turner was the son of a barber, and Faraday the son of a
      horseshoer. Coleridge was a charity-lad, and the number of tanners' and
      tallow-chandlers' offspring, without whose names history could not be
      written, is something amazing. We may trace the genius of Turner from the
      first impulse of his pencil to its latest masterpiece, but we can not find
      that he discovered the solar spectrum or described the Edison phonograph.
      He knew and practiced what he was <i>taught</i> (albeit he taught
      himself), and died quite contented to leave his own works behind him.
      Robert Burns was fully as unlettered and as rustic a plowboy as could be
      desired to prove the mighty miracle of genius. His history, up to a
      certain point, is the very duplicate of the history of William
      Shakespeare, the butcher's boy and prodigy of Stratford village. Both were
      obscure, schoolless, and grammarless. But, in the case of Robert Burns,
      this heaven-born genius did not set him straightway on so lofty a pinnacle
      that he could circumspect the past, and forecast the future, or guide his
      untaught pen to write of Troy and Egypt, of Athens and Cyprus, or to
      reproduce the very counterfeit civiliza<span class="pagenum">163</span><a
      name="link163" id="link163"></a>tions and manners of nations born and
      buried and passed into history a thousand years before he had been
      begotten, the very names of which were not dreamed of anywhere in the
      neighborhood of his philosophy; of the most unusual and hidden details of
      forgotten polities and commercial customs, such as, for instance, the
      exceptional usage of a certain trade in Mitylene, the anomalous status of
      a Moorish mercenary in command of a Venetian army, of a savage queen of
      Britain led captive by Rome, or a thane of Scotland under one of its
      primitive kings&mdash;matters of curious and occult research for
      antiquaries or dilettanti to dig out of old romances or treatises or
      statutes, rather than for historians to treat of or schools to teach! In
      the case of Robert Burns we are content not to ask too much, even of
      genius. Let us be content if the genius of Bobert Burns could glorify the
      goodwives' fables of his wonted firesides and set in aureole the homeliest
      cipher in his vicinage, until a field-mouse became a poem or a milkmaid a
      Venus! It were unreasonable to demand that this genius, this fire from
      heaven, at once and on the instant invest a letterless peasant-lad with
      all the lore and law which the ages behind him had shut up in clasped
      books and buried and forgotten&mdash;with all the learning that the past
      had gathered into great tomes and piled away in libraries. And yet, if
      Bobert Burns had sung of the Punic wars or the return of the Heraclides,
      some Malone or DeQuincy or Charles Knight would doubtless&mdash;with
      history staring him in the face&mdash;have arisen to put his index-finger
      upon the sources of his authority. Judging by the record in the case of
      William Shakespeare, history is able to oppose no difficulty <span
      class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164" id="link164"></a>over which a
      Malone or DeQuincy or Charles Knight can not easily clamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      If William Shakespeare was a born genius, a true son of nature, his soul
      overflowing with a sense of the beauty of life and of love, Land of all
      around him, we might expect to find his poems brimful of the sweet,
      downcast eyes of his Anne, of sunny Stratford fields, of Shottery and the
      lordly oaks of Charlecote&mdash;to find him, "Fancy's child," warbling
      "his native Wood-notes wild," indeed! But of Troy, Tyre, and Epidamnium,
      of Priam and Cressid and Cleopatra, of the propulsion of blood from the
      vital heart, and of the eternal mysteries of physics, who dreams that
      "sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child" could sing in the very speech and
      idiom of those forgotten towns and times, or within the mathematical
      exactitude of sciences that had not yet been treated of in books? Or,
      again, John Bunyan is a case in point. John Bunyan was as squalid and
      irredeemable a tinker as ever flourished in the days when "a tinker was
      rogue by statute." * And yet he, according to Macaulay, produced the
      second of the two books of which England should be proudest. ** What was
      the miracle in the case of John Bunyan? He produced a book which, "while
      it obtains admiration from the most fastidious critics, is loved by those
      who are too simple to admire it.... This is the highest miracle of art,
      that things which<span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165"
      id="link165"></a>are not should be as though they were; that the
      imaginations of one mind should become the personal recollections of
      another. And this miracle the tinker has wrought."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Cockayne vs. Hopkins, 2 Lev., 214.

     **  "Though there were many clever men in England during the
     latter half of the seventeenth century, there were only two
     minds which possessed the imaginative faculty in a very
     eminent degree. One of these minds produced the 'Paradise
     Lost,' and the other the 'Pilgrim's Progress.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      But this great praise was not abstracted from Macaulay by wealth of
      antique learning, universal accuracy of information, or vivid portraiture
      of forgotten civilizations. There was no trace of Bun-yan's perfect
      familiarity with Plato and Euripides, with Galen, Paracelsus, Plautus,
      Seneca, and the long line of authors down to Boccaccio, Rabelais,
      Saxo-Grammaticus, and the rest! The critic did not find in Bunyan's pages
      the careful diction of a scholar, the sonorous speech of the ancients, or
      the elegant and punctilious Norman of the court. "The Bunyan vocabulary,"
      says Macaulay, "is the vocabulary of the common people. There is not an
      expression, if we except a few technical theological terms, which would
      puzzle the rudest peasant." In short, we need not pause, marvelous as are
      the pages of the "Pilgrim's Progress," to ask of John Bunyan, as indeed we
      must ask of William Shakespeare, the question, "how knoweth this man
      letters, having never learned?" Peerless as the result all is, there is
      nothing in the writings of John Bunyan which can not be accounted for by
      natural (that is to say, by what we have been obliged by the course of
      human experience to accept as not impossible) causes. "The years of
      Bunyan's boyhood were those during which the Puritan spirit was in the
      highest vigor over all England.... It is not wonderful, therefore, that a
      lad to whom nature had given a powerful imagination and sensibility which
      amounted to a disease, should have been early haunted by religious
      terrors. Before he was ten, his sports <span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a>were interrupted by fits of remorse and
      despair, and bis sleep disturbed by dreams of fiends trying to fly away
      with him.... He enters the Parliamentary army, and, to the last, he loves
      to draw his illustrations of sacred things from camps and fortresses,
      guns, trumpets, flags of truce, and regiments arrayed, each under its own
      banner.... His 'Greatheart,' his 'Captain Boanerges,5 and his 'Captain
      Credence' are evidently portraits of which the originals were among those
      martial saints* who fought and expounded in Fairfax's army.... He had been
      five years a preacher when the Restoration put it in the power of the
      Cavaliers... to oppress the Dissenters.... he was flung into Bedford jail,
      with pen and paper for company, etc., etc. Here are the school and the
      experience, and the result is writings which show a keen mother wit, a
      great command of the homely mother tongue, an intimate knowledge of the
      English bible, and a vast and dearly bought spiritual experience." **
      Moreover, here is a scholar like Macaulay striving to account for the
      extraordinary phenomenon of a "Pilgrim's Progress" written by a village
      tinker. But in the case of the at least equally extraordinary phenomenon
      of the Shakespearean drama, the creation of a village butcher, the scholar
      has not yet been born to the Shakespeareans who deems it necessary or
      profitable to try his hand at any such investigation. "Where did he get
      his material?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he picked it up around Stratford, somehow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his learning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he found it lying around the theater somewhere!"

      <span class="pagenum">167</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a>Probably
      there were encyclopaedias to be fished ont of the mad of the bank-side in
      those days, of which we can find no mention in the chroniclers! And so,
      although scarcely a commentator on the glowing text has not paused in
      wonder at the vastness and magnificence of this material, leading him on
      to vaster and more magnificent treasuries at every step, so far as we are
      able to discover, not one of them has attempted to trace the intellectual
      experience of the man who wrought it all out of the book and volume of his
      unaided brain. Not one of them has paused to ask the Scriptural question,
      "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" For, it can not be
      too incessantly reiterated, the question is not, "Was Shakespeare a poet?"
      but, "Had he access to the material from which the plays are composed?"
      Admit him to have been the greatest poet, the most frenzied genius in the
      world; where did he get&mdash;not the poetry, but&mdash;the classical,
      philosophical, chemical, historical, astronomical, geological, etc., etc.,
      information&mdash;the facts that crowd these pages?
    </p>
    <p>
      And let us not be credited, in these pages, with a malignant rejection of
      every tradition or anecdote that works to William Shakespeare's renown,
      and a corresponding retention of every tradition or anecdote to his
      disparagement. For example, if it is asked, Why reject the story of King
      James's autograph letter, and retain the story of the trespass on Sir
      Thomas Lucy's deer? the answer must be: first; because, while there is
      nothing improbable in the latter, there is much of improbability in the
      former. King James was a king, and kings rarely write autograph letters to
      subjects. The Lord Chamberlain may give a sort of permission <span
      class="pagenum">168</span><a name="link168" id="link168"></a>to a
      haberdasher to call himself haberdasher to Queen Victoria; but it would be
      vastly improbable that Queen Victoria should write an autograph letter to
      the haberdasher to that effect. Second, because the poaching story (to use
      a legal test) appears to be so old that the memory of man runneth not to a
      time when it was not believed; whereas the King James story first appeared
      in the year 1710, in a biographical notice affixed to an edition of the
      plays prepared by one Bernard Lintot. Mr. Lintot gave no authority for the
      statement whatever, except to say that it rested on the word of "a
      credible person then living." But everybody can appreciate the zeal and
      appetite with which rival biographers, like rival newspaper reporters,
      struggle to get hold of a new fact for their columns, and nobody will
      wonder that, after Mr. Lintot, no "biographer" omitted to mention it. As a
      matter of fact, the letter from King James and the letter from Queen
      Elizabeth, produced by young Ireland, are equally genuine correspondence.
      But the stories of the latter class, while not beyond question, are at
      least not improbable, considering the record of the youth Shakespeare at
      Stratford, while those of the first are certainly improbable on their
      face, and can be in almost every case traced to their exact source.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the story of his holding horses, while by no means authentic, (Mr White
      says it was not heard of until the middle of the last century), is by no
      means improbable, seeing that the lad ran away to London&mdash;&mdash;and
      Rowe and the old sexton both agree that he began&mdash;as self-made men do&mdash;at
      the bottom. The story of Queen Elizabeth's crossing the stage and dropping
      her glove, which Shakespeare picked up and pre<span class="pagenum">169</span><a
      name="link169" id="link169"></a>sented with an impromptu, Mr. White
      himself smiles at, with the remark that "the anecdote is plainly one made
      to meet the craving for personal details of Shakespeare's life," * and he
      treats it as he does the "Florio" in the British Museum, supposed to have
      belonged to William Shakespeare, because that name is written&mdash;&mdash;after
      his mode&mdash;on a fly-leaf; with a pleasant wish that he were able to
      believe in it. *

      Far from being of the class that kings delight to honor, it is simply
      impossible to turn one's researches into any channel that leads into the
      vicinity of Stratford without noticing the fact that the Shakespeare
      family left, in the neighborhoods where it flourished, one unmistakable
      trace familiar in all cases of vulgar and illiterate families; namely, the
      fact that they never knew or cared, or made an effort to know, of what
      vowels or consonants their own name was composed, or even to preserve the
      skeleton of its pronunciation. They answered&mdash;or made their marks&mdash;indifferently
      to "Saxpir" or "Chaksper;" or to any other of the thirty forms given by
      Mr. Grant White, ** or the fifty-five forms which another gentleman of
      elegant leisure has been able to collect. ***

      In the marriage bond of November 28, 1582, it is twice written, each time
      Shagspere. On the grave of Susanna, it is Shakespere; and on the other
      graves of the family, Shakespeare, except that under the bust it is
      Shakspeare. That is to say, just as many orthographies as there are
      tombstones and inscriptions. Any lawyer's clerk who has had occasion to
      search for evidence among the uneducated classes, knows how certainly a
      lower or higher grade of intelligence will manifest itself primarily in an
      ignorance of or indifference to one's own name or a corresponding zeal for
      one's own identity, and anxiety that it shall be accurately "taken down."
      Whether this infallible rule obtained in the days of the Shakespeares or
      not, or whether a family, that was so utterly stolid as not to know if
      their patronymic was spelled with a "c," a "k," or an "x," could have
      appreciated and bestowed upon their child a classical education (not to
      ring the changes upon politics, philosophy, etc., right here), is for the
      reader to judge for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. H. Smith maintains that Shakespeare, like the rest of his family,
      was unable to write, and had learned, by practice only, to make the
      signature which he was assured was his name. Mr. Smith founds his theory
      on the fact that, in the Will the word "seale" (in the formula, "witness
      my seale," etc.) is erased, <span class="pagenum">171</span><a
      name="link171" id="link171"></a>and the word "hand" substituted. In a
      letter to Mr. Shedding, * Mr. Smith claims that this erasure and
      substitution prove that the draughtsman who prepared the Shakespeare Will,
      knowing that the testator could not write, did not suppose that he would
      sign his name, and so prepared it for the superimposition of his seal. "I
      know," says Mr. Smith, "that you will ingeniously observe that that might
      have been his belief, but that the fact could better have been proved if '<i>hand</i>'
      had been erased and '<i>seale</i>' inserted. But Shakespeare, being proud
      of his writing, and, as this would probably be his last opportunity,
      insisted on exhibiting his 'hand.'" According to Mr. Smith, therefore, Ben
      Jonson's speech about "never blotting out a line," was redundant. But,
      whether able to write, or, like his ancestors and descendants, signing
      with a mark, he clearly cared no more than they how people spelled his
      name. A Mr. George Wise, of Philadelphia, has been able to compile a chart
      exhibiting one thousand nine hundred and six ways of spelling the
      Stratford boy's name; ** A commentary on the efforts of Mr. Halliwell and
      others, to establish the canonical orthography, which might well reduce
      them to despair. The fact is, that there can no more be a canonical
      spelling of the name Shakespeare than there can be a canonical face of the
      boy William. The orthography of Shakespeare, as now accepted, and the face
      now accepted as belonging to William of that name, are both modern
      inventions.

      Even the <span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>"best
      of that family" (according to the old clerk), William, when called to sign
      his own last will and testament (obliged by law to sign each of the three
      sheets upon which it was engrossed) three times, spelled his name a
      different way each time. His daughter Judith lived and died without being
      able to spell or write it at all; Milton, Spenser, Sidney, even Gower and
      Chaucer (whom even our own Artemus Ward pronounced "no speller"), had but
      one way of writing their own names&mdash;and never dreamed of one thousand
      nine hundred and six. The name is now supposed to have been simply
      "Jacques-Pierre" (James Peter), which had been mispronounced&mdash;as
      Englishmen mispronounce French&mdash;for unnumbered generations. *
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the present mispronunciation of Jacques prevalent in Warwickshire.
      And, such being the true origin of the name, it is, of course, natural to
      find it as we do, written in two words "Shake-speare," in those days. It
      is not William Shakespeare's fault that he sprang from an illiterate
      family, but that&mdash;after growing so rich as to be able to enjoy an
      income of $25,000 a year, he should never send his children&mdash;especially
      his daughter Judith&mdash;to school, so that the poor girl, on being
      married, on the 11th day of February, 1616, should be obliged to sign her
      marriage bond with a mark, shows, we think, that he was not that immortal

      days when William Shakespeare first appeared in London, happened to be the
      days when the Renaissance had reached England, and the drama which began
      then for the first time to be produced, was the English Renaissant Drama&mdash;just
      throwing off the crudities of the old miracle and mystery plays borrowed
      from the continent, and beginning to be English and original. Moreover,
      letters and learning, so long exclusively confined to the rich and gentle,
      began to find expressions in other ranks. "The mob of gentlemen who write
      with ease" were, one and all, beginning to use their pens. There were no
      village newspapers with their "Poet's Corners," and these writers sent
      their manuscripts through the only channel at hand&mdash;the green-room
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these scores of manuscripts came in, William Shakespeare, of Stratford,
      now Mr. Manager Shakespeare of the Blackfriars, read them over; took out a
      scene here and an act there; scissored them as he pleased; made this
      "heavy" for the low comedian, and that for the "first old man;" adjusted
      the "love business," made "practical" for his boards all the <span
      class="pagenum">175</span><a name="link175" id="link175"></a>nature and
      humor, and cut out all that came flat, stale, and unprofitable from the
      amateur's hand; even took a little of each to make a new one, if
      necessary, (thus retaining the indicia that <i>this</i> was written by a
      lawyer, <i>that</i> by a physician, <i>this</i> by a soldier, <i>that</i>
      by a chemist, etc., etc.). He did what Dumas, Boucicault and Daly do
      to-day; he was, in other words, the stage editor, not the author, of the
      Shakespearean drama; though, that it should be called by his name, is,
      perhaps, the least unusual thing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the gentlemen who used their pens, the very recent dissolution of
      the monasteries had thrown multitudes of "learned clerks," (the "clerical"
      profession then including lawyers and physicians, and indeed all
      book-learned men) upon their own resources for daily bread, and there was
      only one depot for their work. Not three, but three thousand men there
      were, other things being equal, more competent by education at least, than
      William Shakespeare to write the Shakespearean drama. But other things, as
      we shall see, were not equal. It is suggested, on the one hand, that
      William Shakespeare wrote the plays; on the other hand, that Francis Bacon
      wrote them; and, again, that Sir Walter Raleigh wrote them. So far as mere
      dates go, any one of the three might have written them. They were all
      three in London, and on the ground when the plays appeared. The truth is
      perhaps somewhere among the three. Francis Bacon was the most learned man
      of his time. He could and did read Greek in the original, and he did have
      access to untranslated manuscripts, such as the "Men√¶clnni" of Plautus. He
      was a philosopher, and he <i>did</i> come nearer to a prescience of the
      philosophy of ages to be, than any man who <span class="pagenum">176</span><a
      name="link176" id="link176"></a>ever lived&mdash;as witness his own
      acknowledged works. Sir Walter Raleigh was a wit and a poet, a gentleman,
      a man of elegant nonchalance, a very Mercutio, to the day of his
      execution. He was liberally educated, cultured, and would have been all
      this in a more cultivated day than his own; moreover, he was idle and a
      scribbler of belles-lettres. Perhaps he killed time by writing speeches
      for the obsequious manager to put into plays for his stage. Anonymous or
      pseudonymic authorship has ever been a penchant of the gentle and idle.
      Shakespeare, let us say, was a shrewd man of business, who kept up with
      his times, as do managers of theaters to-day; he was quick to perceive
      where a point might be made in his plays, and moreover he employed&mdash;or
      perhaps was fortunate enough to secure by way of friendship&mdash;a poet
      to turn his ideas into speech for the mouths of his players. That he used
      his pen to prepare the prompter's manuscript of the pieces performed at
      his theater, we have already seen there is reason to believe. That he ever
      composed, on his own account, we have only a sort of innuendo of certain
      of his brother actors and playwrights, and a Stratford tradition, which we
      can trace to no other source than the source of the belief outside&mdash;that
      is to say, to the fact that the plays were produced under his management
      in London. The innuendo dubs him a poet; the Stratford tradition makes him
      to have written doggerel verses. But some have ventured to disbelieve both
      the innuendo and the tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, writing his life, as we do, from imagination, it is much easier to
      imagine the three men&mdash;Bacon, Raleigh, and Shakespeare&mdash;producing
      between them "Hamlet,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Othello," or the "Comedy of Errors," <span class="pagenum">177</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a>than to imagine William Shakespeare alone
      doing it. Especially since, apart from the internal evidence of the plays,
      he "had his hands full" of work besides&mdash;the work in which he earned
      his competency. It can not be too clearly borne in mind that Shakespeare,
      in a space of ten or twelve years, actually made what is a fair fortune
      to-day. That Bacon and Raleigh, whose ambitions did not lead them to seek
      renown as playwrights, should have contributed their share to the plays&mdash;the
      first for gold which he needed, and the second for pastime which he craved&mdash;is
      not remarkable; we can see hundreds of young lawyers scribbling for gold
      while waiting for practice, or young "swells" trying their hand at
      comedies for the sport of the thing, by opening our eyes to-day. That the
      shrewd and successful manager should carefully pick into presentable and
      playable shape for his stage, these productions of his young friends, is,
      likewise, the easiest thing in the world to conceive of, or to see
      managers doing to-day. Possibly, William Shakespeare, or some other
      skilled playwright, took the dialogues&mdash;let us say, for example&mdash;of
      Bacon and Raleigh, put them into the form of plays, introduced a clown
      here or a jade there, interpolated saws and localisms, gave the characters
      their names, looked out for the "business," arranged the tableaux&mdash;in
      short, did what Mr. Wal-lack, or Mr. Daly, or Mr. Boucicault would have to
      do to-day to fit a play for the stage. It is thought that Shakespeare
      himself did it, because the plays are said to have been seen in his
      handwriting, and because, from that fact or otherwise, they went by his
      name in the days when they were first produced in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of joint authorship would not only explain <span class="pagenum">178</span><a
      name="link178" id="link178"></a>away the antagonism which grew up between
      the evidence of the man Shakespeare and the evidence of the Shakespearean
      plays, but account for the difficulties of accepting any
      anti-Shakespearean theory. This would explain the parallel passages in
      Bacon's writings and in the plays which Judge Holmes has so painstakingly
      sorted out; the little inaccuracies of law and of grammar, of geography
      and of history, in the plays themselves; Mr. Greene's "sea-coast of
      Bohemia," or the introduction of gunpowder at the seige of Troy&mdash;absurdities
      which it is morally impossible to suppose of the portrayer of antiquity
      who wrote "Julius C√¶sar," or the knowledge that framed the historical
      plays. If, however, we consider them as the interpolations of a
      stage-wright * aiming at stage effect, they are easily enough accounted
      for.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  It is nothing less than marvelous that this simple
     explanation should not have occurred to the wise men who
     have been knocking their heads against "the sea-coast of
     Bohemia" for the last hundred years. That this error is a
     part of the "business" and not of the play, is very evident
     from a casual reading of Act III., Scene III. The stage
     direction for that scene is simply, "Scene&mdash;a desert
     country near the sea," to be sure there is no stage
     direction of any sort in the "first folio" but we may be
     sure that this was the proper stage setting of the piece.
     And to fit it, Antigonus, the first speaker, says to the
     mariner: "Art thou perfect, then? Our ship hath touched the
     deserts of Bohemia." Bobert Green makes the same mistake in
     his "Dorastus and Faunia." It was, if any thing, a vulgar
     error of the time. There is no further allusion to the
     troublesome geography in the play. So, too, the gunpowder
     used at the seige of Troy is a part of the "business," and
     should be assigned where it belongs&mdash;to the playwright and
     not to the dramatist. Not only did the stage editor put it
     in, but he took it out of Green's "Dorastus and Faunia."
</pre>
    <p>
      The stagewright saw an opportunity for the introduction of a stage ship or
      shipwreck, hence <span class="pagenum">179</span><a name="link179"
      id="link179"></a>he puts in the borrowed "sea-coast." He needs an alarum
      of guns to impress his audience on the coming evening with the fact that a
      tight is in progress. And even if it should occur to him to doubt if there
      were any guns at the siege of Ilium, he is pretty certain that it will not
      occur to the groundlings or the penny seats, from whose pocket all is
      grist that comes to his mill, if he makes the guns and the cannon a part
      of the "business." So, again, we have only to understand this, and the
      characters of Hym and Bardolph&mdash;supposed to have puzzled the critics
      since critics first began to busy themselves with these dramas&mdash;is
      explained. Bardolph is the walking comedian, inserted by the experienced
      manager to tickle the frieti ciceris et nucis emptor, with his fiery nose,
      and corporal Nym to break in with his "There's the humor of it," just as
      rip Van Winkle dwells upon his favorite toast, and Solon Shingle upon his
      ancestor who "fitted into the Revolution." And to many minds this accounts
      for the little dashes of obscene display, the lewd innuendo, which came
      never from the same pen as the masterstrokes, but which they prefer to
      conceive of an actor or manager interpolating to the delight of Monsieur
      Taine's audience, and for the stolen delectation of the maids of honor and
      city dames who went, in men's clothes, to mingle with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, too, might account for the poems dedicated to Southampton. In the
      lax court and reign of the Virgin Queen, there was at least one man bold
      and reckless enough to stand patron to the "Venus and Adonis" and "The
      Rape of Lucrece"&mdash;the noble young libertine of nineteen, Southampton.
      Similarly, there may have been but one man available upon <span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>whom to
      father them, and so the joint or several productions of certain young men
      about town, "curled darlings" who affected Shakespeare's green-room, were
      sworn upon the complacent manager, who doubtless saw his profit in it. We
      have rumor, indeed, that his profit was no less a sum than one thousand
      pounds. But, as we have seen, and shall see further, this thousand pounds
      story is not only without authority, but incredible: that Southampton's
      means did not justify him in giving away any such sum&mdash;that
      Shakespeare did not need it, and that none of Southampton's coterie ever
      heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Bacon wrote these works or not (and we may say the same of
      Raleigh), and whether the audiences before whom these Shakespearean dramas
      were first presented could have estimated them as what we of this age
      recognize them to be or not; we may be sure that, had he chanced to light
      upon them, Lord Bacon could have appraised them, and the genius that
      created them, at their true worth. But while Lord Bacon's writings teem
      with mention of his own contemporaries (Mr. W. II. Smith points out the
      fact that we owe about all we know of Raleigh's skill in repartee to
      Bacon's "Apothegms"), he nowhere alludes to such a man as William
      Shakespeare!&mdash;to William Shakespeare&mdash;who, if popular belief is
      true, was his lordship's most immortal contemporary, the one mind mightier
      than Bacon's, and yet not a rival or a superior in his own particular
      sphere, of whom he could have been jealous. The truth which makes this
      strange riddle plain is, according to the Baconian theory, that (to use
      Sir Tobie Matthew's words in his famous letter to his patron) "the most
      <span class="pagenum">181</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a>prodigious
      wit that ever I knew, of my nation, and of this side of the sea, is of
      your lordship's name, though he be known by another," in other words, that
      Bacon was "Shakespeare." And, indeed, Sir Tobie was fonder of nothing than
      of indulging in sly allusions to Lord Bacon's secret, of which he had
      become possessed. In another letter than that just quoted, he says again
      to his lordship: "I will not promise to return you weight for weight, but
      <i>measure for measure</i>....and there is a certain judge in the world,
      who, in the midst of his popularity toward the meaner sort of men, would
      fain deprive the better sort of that happiness which was generally done in
      that time." * **

      Such considerations as these, as they came one by one to light, began to
      suggest to thinking minds that perhaps William Shakespeare was enjoying,
      by default, estates belonging to somebody else. But it is curious to see
      how gradually. In 1783, Theobald, a competent and painstaking scholar of
      the text, declares that there were "portions of the plays which proved
      beyond a doubt that more than one hand had produced them." More than fifty
      years after came Dr. Richard Banner (who wrote his famous letter on "The
      Learning of Shakespeare," in or about 1789), and appears to have been the
      first actual anti-Shakespearean and unbeliever. Dr. Farmer sought&mdash;by
      demonstrating that much of the learning of the plays could have been, by
      sufficient research, procured at second-hand&mdash;to account for (what he
      could not overlook) the utter inadequacy of the historical man to the
      immortal work <span class="pagenum">182</span><a name="link182"
      id="link182"></a>assigned him; just as if it were not, if any thing, an
      increase (or say a substitution) of marvels to suppose a busy actor and
      manager rummaging England for forgotten manuscripts in the days when no
      public libraries existed, and when students lived in cloisters; or (let us
      say) that he knew precisely where to lay his hand on every obscure tract,
      letter, or memorandum ever drawn from a classical source! And just as if
      the encyclopaedic learning required was lessened by the fact that the plot
      of the perfected play was borrowed or rewritten from an older drama of the
      same name!
    </p>
    <p>
      For example of Farmer's argument, take the following. In the play of that
      name, Timon says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "The sun's a thief, and with his great attention
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Robs the vast sea. The moon's an arrant thief,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The moon into salt tears. The earth's a thief
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From general excrement: each thing's a thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, exclaim the men who upho'd the stage manager's ability to read Greek,
      the idea of this is from Anacreon, and they give the ode in which William
      Shakespeare found it. Not so fast, says Dr. Farmer. He might have taken it
      from the French of Ronsard, a French poet: because one Puttenham, in his
      "Arte of English Poesie," published in 1589, speaks of some one&mdash;of a
      "reasonable good facilitie in translation, who, finding certain of
      Anacreon's odes very well translated by Ronsard, the French poet&mdash;comes
      a minion and translates the same out of French into English," and "on
      looking into Ronsard I find this very ode of Anacreon among the rest!"
      <span class="pagenum">183</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>Letting
      pass the far-fetched conjecture which aims to prove that William
      Shakespeare could not read Greek by showing that he could reach French&mdash;or
      the observation, that the sum of Dr. Farmer's arguments (for the above is
      a sample of each and all of them) amounts simply to this, that: though the
      manager knew no Greek&mdash;he knew where every thing contained in Greek
      was to be obtained in translation: the question for us is simply, Why
      should the stage-manager have recourse to either Anacreon or Ronsard for a
      meteorological episode? This, and a thousand like passages, are nothing
      but digressions, with nothing whatever to do with the action or by-play of
      the comedy or tragedy in which they occur, and not apposite to anything
      else in the part of the speakers who pronounced them. A scholar might be
      unable to keep them out; but why should a stage-manager&mdash;fitting a
      spectacle to the acting necessities of his boards or to the humor of his
      audience&mdash;put them in? Whereas, if a scholar did write the manuscript
      play and sell it to a stage-manager, it is useless to ask why the
      stage-manager did not cut out the digression or why he left it in, for
      that was a mere matter of whim or circumstance, not worth our while to
      speculate over. Dr. Farmer went just far enough to see that, if the
      William Shakespeare of history wrote the Book, something must be done to
      account for his access to the material he wrought with. If the Doctor had
      kept on a little further, the truth would have dawned upon him. But, as it
      was, he (without looking for them) observed traces of what he believed to
      be two hands in the Plays, and so followed Theobald. He says of Hamlet,
      that he considered it "extremely probable that the French ribaldry in the
      <span class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>last
      scene of Hamlet was the work of another than the author of the body of the
      work"&mdash;but the hint was altogether lost on him. He looked no further,
      and so lived and died unsuspicious of the truth&mdash;namely, that it was
      only the fair-copied manuscript that was William Shakespeare's. The
      "without blotting a line" of Ben Jonson&mdash;not a mere form of speech,
      but a fact, confirmed by Heminges and Condell, the editors of the "first
      folio" of 1623, who say in their preface, "we have scarce received from
      him a blot in his papers"&mdash;as we shall see further on, ought to have
      itself awakened suspicion. Lope de Vega, the Spaniard, who supplied his
      native stage with upward of two thousand original dramas&mdash;who is
      computed to have written upward of 21,300,000 verses, and who wrote so
      hurriedly that he never had time to unravel his intrigues, but cut them
      all open "with a knife" in the last act&mdash;probably did write "without
      blotting a line." At least so Mr. Hallam thinks, adding that, "nature
      would have overstepped her bounds, and have produced the miraculous, had
      Lope de Vega, along with this rapidity and invention, attained perfection
      in any department of literature." * But in the case of these marvelous
      Shakespeare plays, it was preferred to believe that nature <i>had</i>
      "produced the marvelous," rather than accept the simple truth that what
      Hem-inges and Condell and Ben Jonson saw, were the engrossed parts written
      out for each actor, and not the first drafts of the poet, improvising as
      he wrote.

      Except that Mr. Spedding, in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for February,
      1852, printed a paper "Who wrote <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a> Shakespeare's Henry VIII?"&mdash;in which
      he claimed to have found startling traces of two hands in that play, (and
      possibly some other floating papers which have escaped our search)&mdash;prior
      to the year 1852 it had occurred to nobody (except Kitty, in "High Life
      Below Stairs") to ask the question, "Who Wrote Shakespeare?" But, in
      August of that year an anonymous writer, in Chambers' "Edinburgh Journal,"
      distinctly and for the first time discussed the question, "Who wrote
      Shakespeare?"&mdash;when, after going overmuch of the ground we have
      already traversed, arrived, to his own "extreme dissatisfaction," (as he
      says, at the conclusion), that William Shakespeare "kept a poet." It is
      curious to find this anonymous writer dealing, as airily as Lady Bab
      herself, with the question: and (while unconscious of the elaborate
      network of evidence he might have summoned, and suggesting no probable
      author by name) actually foreshadowing the laborious conviction which,
      four years later, Delia Bacon was to announce. He surmises, indeed, that
      William Shakespeare was a sort of showman, whose interest in the immortal
      plays was a purchased interest&mdash;precisely what the law at present
      understands by "proprietary copyright."

      "The plays apparently arise... as the series goes on; all at once
      Shakespeare, with a fortune, leaves London, and the supply ceases. Is this
      compatible with a genius thus culminating, on any other supposition than
      the death of the poet and the survival of the employer?" Of this
      supposititious hack-author, who dies, and leaves to William Shakespeare
      the halo of his genius as well as the profit of his toil, this anonymous
      writer draws a picture <span class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186"
      id="link186"></a>that has something familiar in its coloring. "May not
      William Shakespeare," he asks, "the cautious, calculating man, careless of
      fame, and intent only on money-making, have found, in some farthest garret
      over-looking the 'silent highway of the Thames,' some pale, wasted
      student... who, with eyes of genius gleaming through despair, was about,
      like Chatterton, to spend his last copper coin upon some cheap and speedy
      means of death? What was to hinder William Shakespeare from reading,
      appreciating, and purchasing these dramas, and thereafter 'keeping his
      poet,' like Mrs. Packwood?
    </p>
    <p>
      With this view the disputed passages&mdash;those in which critics have
      agreed that the genius is found wanting&mdash;the meretricious ornaments
      sometimes crowded in&mdash;the occasional bad taste&mdash;in short, all
      the imperfections discernible and disputable in these mighty dramas, are
      reconcilable with their being the interpolations of Shakespeare himself on
      his poet's works. * Miss Delia Bacon, a remarkable lady, followed in a
      paper printed in "Putnam's Magazine," in its issue of January, 1856, (and
      therefore must have written it in 1855), and was supposed therein to
      distinctly announce and maintain that Lord Bacon&mdash;her namesake by
      coincidence&mdash;was the "Shakespeare" wanted&mdash;a supposition which,
      as we shall see, was erroneous.

      went to England, but found that&mdash;while at home she was treading only
      on adverse sentiment&mdash;<i>there</i> she was openly tampering with
      vested rights, almost with the unwritten constitution of England. She made
      a few personal friends, and found some sympathizers, but all England was
      arrayed against her. She came back, heart-broken, and died eight months
      later. Mr. William Henry Smith, of London, in September, 1856, appeared
      with his "Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakespeare's Plays? A Letter to
      Lord Ellesmere," in which the Baconian theory was very plainly and
      circumspectly laid down and admirably maintained. * The presumption once
      disturbed, inquiry began to be diverted from the well-worn track of the
      commentators, and the result has been, we think, a candid, rational, and
      patient attempt to study the Shakespearean writings by the aid of
      contemporary history rather than by mere conjecture, and by the record
      rather than by fancy, guess-work, and gossip.

     * This "Letter," which was reprinted in "Littell's Living
     Age," (No. 56), for November, 1856, was, the following year
     (1857) elaborated into the valuable work on which we have so
     unsparingly drawn in these pages, and to which we
     acknowledge our exceeding obligation ("Bacon and
     Shakespeare: An Inquiry touching Players, Playhouses, and
     Play writers in the days of Elizabeth. By William Henry
     Smith. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1857"). In this work Mr.
     Smith (in his preface) asserts that at the date of his
     letter to Lord Ellesmere, he had never seen Miss Bacon's
     article in "Putnam's," but, it is to be observed, no where
     claims to have been the originator of the "Baconian Theory."

      id="link188"></a>defined anti-Stratfordian theories have offered
      themselves already, as substitutes for the mossy and venerable fossil
      remains of the commentators. These theories are:

      it).
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE DELIA BACON THEORY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was across no dethroned and shattered intellect that there first
      flashed the truth it has been the essay of these papers to rehearse. That
      Delia Bacon&mdash;who, earliest in point of time, announced to the world
      that "Shakespeare" was the name of a <i>book</i>, and not the name of its
      author; and who, contenting herself with the bare announcement, soon
      passed on to the theory we are now about to notice&mdash;was pelted with a
      storm of derision, abuse, and merciless malice, until in poverty,
      sickness, and distress, but still in a grand silence, she passed out of
      sight for ever, is true enough. That in the midst of it all she still
      struggled on in what she believed to be "the world's work"&mdash;bearing
      more than it was ever intended a woman should bear&mdash;is not to
      overweigh any merit her scheme of the Shakespearean plays may have
      possessed, however it may have eventuated in the "madness" so inseparably
      connected with her name. Wherever Delia Bacon <i>died,</i> she lived and
      moved in the conviction that she was a worker in the world's workshop.
      What to us is a mere cold, historical formulary, seems, however, we may
      smile at the absurdity, to have seized upon her whole life and being; and,
      as in a great crusade <span class="pagenum">189</span><a name="link189"
      id="link189"></a>against a universal error, she seems to have struggled in
      loneliness and wretchedness, with a crusader's faith and a martyr's
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all her tragic life, Delia Bacon appears never to have paused to
      formulate the theory, for ever to be associated with her name, as to the
      actual authorship of the plays. The paper "William Shakespeare and his
      Plays," which appeared in "Putnam's Magazine" (and inaugurated the
      controversy, never thereafter to "down" at anybody's bidding), seems to
      treat the matter as already settled. It is rather sarcasm at the expense
      of those who rejected the theory of a non-Shakespearean authorship than a
      formulation of the theory itself. That the sarcasm, as a sustained effort,
      has rarely if ever been equaled, there certainly can be no question. Her
      indignation at the idea that the magnificent plays sprang from the brain
      of "the Stratford poacher&mdash;now that the deer-stealing fire has gone
      out of him; now that this youthful impulse has been taught its
      conventional mental limits, sobered into the mild, sagacious, witty Mr.
      Shakespeare of the Globe," is intense. "What is to hinder Mr. Shakespeare,
      the man who keeps the theater on the bank-side, from working himself into
      a frenzy when he likes, and scribbling out, unconsciously, Lears, and
      Macbeths and Hamlets, merely as the necessary dialogues to the spectacle
      he professionally exhibits!" Her allusion to Bacon is equally impassioned:
      "We should have found, ere this, <i>one</i> with learning broad enough and
      deep enough and subtle enough and comprehensive enough; one with nobility
      of aim and philosophic and poetic genius enough to be able to claim his
      own, his own immortal progeny, unwarped, un<span class="pagenum">190</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a>blinded, undeprived of one ray or dimple
      of that all-pervading reason that informs them&mdash;one who is able to
      reclaim them, even now, 'cured and perfected in their limbs, and absolute
      in full numbers as he conceived them!'" Long before its appearance, as we
      shall proceed to narrate; and still longer before the world had well
      opened its eyes to the fact that a formidable anti-Shakespearean
      proposition had been asserted, its author had left the proposition itself
      leagues behind, and was well along on her route to the fountain-head of
      its inspiration. The problem she proposed to herself was not, "Did Bacon
      and others write the plays?" but "Why did Bacon and others write the plays
      under the name of William Shakespeare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fruit of laborious study of the system and structure of the plays,
      she reached the answer&mdash;as she believed, and lived and died believing&mdash;hidden
      and embalmed in the masterpiece of them all, the tragedy of "Hamlet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hamlet," she maintained, was the master-key that unlocked the whole
      magnificent system. They were not plays, but chapters in a great Treatise&mdash;links
      in a great chain of philosophy&mdash;a new philosophy of politics and of
      life; and, just as the Lord Hamlet caused certain strolling players, with
      the set speech he put into their mouths, to "catch the conscience of the
      king," so had the greatest mind of all the golden age put into the mouths
      of the vagabond Shakespeare and his crew the truth which should, in the
      fullness of time, catch the conscience of the whole world. But why should
      these great minds have chosen to put their philosophy into enigmas and
      ciphers? Miss Bacon's answer was convincing: "It was the time when the
      cipher, in which one could <span class="pagenum">191</span><a
      name="link191" id="link191"></a>write 'omnia per omnia,' was in request;
      when even 'wheel ciphers' and 'doubles' were thought not unworthy of
      philosophic notice. It was a time, too, when the phonographic art was
      cultivated and put to other uses than at present, and when a nomme de
      plume was required for other purposes than to serve as the refuge of an
      author's modesty, or vanity, or caprice. It was a time when puns, and
      charades, and enigmas, and anagrams, and monograms, and ciphers, and
      puzzles were not mere sport and child's play; when they had need to be
      close and solvable only to those <i>who should</i> solve them. It was a
      time when all the latent capacities of the English language were put in
      requisition, and it was flashing and crackling through all its length and
      breadth, with puns and quips and conceits and jokes and satires, and
      inlined with philosophic secrets that opened down into the bottom of a
      tomb, that opened into the Tower, that opened on the scaffold and the
      block." * This was the "Delia Bacon theory." This was the "madness"
      forever associated with her plaintive story, and <i>not</i> the
      proposition that the author of the plays (whoever he might be&mdash;or
      they, if more than one) and William Shakespeare were persons&mdash;as
      distinctly two as were the noble Hamlet and the poor player who played
      "Gonzago" in the "Mousetrap" that day before the majesty of Denmark. But,
      madness or not, Miss Bacon never wavered in her conviction that the
      appointed time to read the oracles had come, and that <i>she</i>, Delia
      Bacon, a namesake, possibly, of the real Hamlet of the plays, had been
      raised in her appointed place to be the reader. Alas for her!

</pre>
    <p>
      By what whim of fortune or fancy the great plays had grown to be known as
      "Shakespeare's works," any more than Burbage's works, or Jonson's works,
      she never troubled herself to inquire; but with the details of lier
      mission she was careful to possess herself. She held that "the material
      evidence of her dogma as to the authorship, together with the key of the
      new philosophy, would be found buried in Shakespeare's grave." * She
      claims to have discovered, by careful study of Lord Bacon's letters, not
      only the key and clew to the whole mystery, but to an entire Baconian
      cipher In these letters&mdash;there were over five hundred of them extant,
      and others have been discovered, we believe, since Miss Bacon's day&mdash;however,
      it still remains, for the secret of Miss Bacon's clew died with her. But
      she stoutly maintained that in these letters were "definite and minute
      directions how to find a will and other documents relating to the conclave
      of Elizabethan philosophers, which were concealed in a hollow space in the
      under surface of Shakespeare's gravestone.... The directions, she
      intimated, were completely and precisely to the point, obviating all
      difficulties in the way of coming to the treasure, and so contrived as to
      ward off any troublesome consequences likely to arise from the
      interference of the parish officers.... There was the precious secret
      protected by a curse, as pirates used to bury their gold in the
      guardianship of a fiend." **

      The original manu<span class="pagenum">193</span><a name="link193"
      id="link193"></a>scripts of the plays she did not expect to find there.
      These she believed the ignorant Shakespeare to have scattered, after the
      blotless copies for the players had been taken; to have devoted to
      domestic purposes, or to have never concerned himself about farther. This
      was the gravamen of the charge she brought against "Lord Leicester's
      groom," the co-manager, late of Stratford, and this the vandalism for
      which she never could forgive him. "This fellow," she cried, "never cared
      a farthing for them, but only for his gains at their hands.... What is to
      hinder his boiling his kettle with the manuscripts... after he had done
      with them? He had those manuscripts&mdash;the original Hamlet, with its
      last finish;... the original Lear, with his own fine readings... he had
      them all&mdash;pointed, emphasized, corrected, as they came from the gods!
      And he has left us to wear out our youth and squander our life in poring
      over and setting right the old garbled copies of the play-house!... For is
      he not a private, economical, practical man, this Shakespeare of ours,
      with no stuff and nonsense about him; a plain, true-blooded Englishman,
      who minds his own <span class="pagenum">194</span><a name="link194"
      id="link194"></a>business, and leaves others to take care of theirs?...
      What did he do with them? He gave them to his cook, or Dr. Hall put up
      potions in them, or Judith&mdash;poor Judith, who signified her relation
      to the author of Lear and the Tempest, and her right to the glory of the
      name he left her, by the very extraordinary kind of 'mark' which she
      affixed to legal instruments&mdash;poor Judith may have curled her hair
      with them to the day of her death.... What did you do with them? You have
      skulked this question long enough; you will have to account for them! The
      awakening ages will put you on the stand, and you will not leave it until
      you answer the question, what did you do with them?" * This chain of
      dramas, so blindly perpetuated by William Shakespeare, became, through
      Miss Bacon's unlocking process, a great system of political philosophy,
      dictated by the thoughtful Bacon and his compeers, and locked up for the
      nineteenth century, against the blindness of the centuries between.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of so startling a proposition, Miss Bacon confesses that the world
      would require something more than her own conviction. So she deliberately
      set out to <i>prove</i>, from the very crypt and silence of the grave
      itself, its truth. To St. Albans, whence the mysterious letters were
      dated, to the lonesome tomb at old Verulam and the vault in Stratford
      chancel, she proposed a pilgrimage&mdash;thence to probe the secret, and
      lay it open to a doubting world. Her friends regarded her theory as a
      delusion, and Miss Bacon as a monomaniac....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  "Putnam's Magazine," January, 1856. <span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a> "to her
     conversations on the subject, and peremptorily refused
     contributions to assist in her expedition. But, by her
     lectures, and the friend she enlisted in her project in New
     York City, she gathered together enough money to get to
     London."

     It was while in London, in abject poverty and
     friendlessness, that Thomas Carlyle, "upon whom she had
     called and whom she had impressed with respect for herself
     if not for her theory," says Hawthorne, advised Miss Bacon
     to put her thoughts upon paper first, before proceeding to
     the overt act of proof she contemplated&mdash;namely, the opening
     of William Shakespeare's grave. It was upon his advice that
     this most remarkable woman&mdash;sitting in bed in a garret to
     keep warm without a fire, without sufficient or wholesome
     food, "looking back," to use her own words, "on the joys and
     sorrows of a world in which I have no longer any place, like
     a departed spirit," and yet, doing "the world's work," and
     knowing "that I had a right to demand aid for it"&mdash;undertook
     to unfold out of the Shakespearean plays their hidden system
     of philosophy." Meanwhile, under a contract obtained for her
     by Mr. P. W. Emerson (though, it is presumed, more for
     temporary supply of funds than as rider to her great work),
     she furnished to "Putnam's Magazine" eighty pages of
     manuscript, which became the famous paper "William
     Shakespeare and his Plays," first announcing to the world
     the first anti-Shakespearean theory of which it had ever
     heard. **

     *  Mrs. Farrar.

     ** This was contracted to be the first of a series of
     papers, but the arrangement for some reason, probably
     because Miss Bacon found it necessary to devote herself to
     the work to which she was to give her life, fell through,
     and no successive papers appeared in the magazine.

     *  "The Philosophy of Shakespeare's Plays unfolded. By Delia
     Bacon." London: Sampson, Low &amp; Co.; and Boston: Ticknor &amp;
     Fields, 1857. The book lies before us, and certainly is the
     most difficult reading we ever attempted. Even so competent
     and partial a critic as Hawthorne says of it: "Without
     prejudice to her literary ability, it must be allowed that
     Miss Bacon was wholly unfit to prepare her own work for
     publication, because, among other reasons, she was too
     thoroughly in earnest to know what to leave out. Every leaf
     and line was sacred, for all had been written under so deep
     a conviction of truth, as to assume, in her eyes, the aspect
     of inspiration. A practiced book-maker, with entire control
     of her material, would have shaped out a duodecimo volume,
     full of eloquent and ingenious dissertation&mdash;criticisms
     which quite take the color and pungency out of other
     people's critical remarks on Shakespeare.... There was a
     great amount of rubbish, which any competent editor would
     have shoveled out of the way. But Miss Bacon thrust the
     whole bulk of inspiration and nonsense into the press in a
     lump, and there tumbled out a ponderous octavo volume, which
     fell with a dead thump at the feet of the public, and has
     never been picked up. A few persons turned over one or two
     of the leaves, as it lay there, and essayed to kick the
     volume deeper into the mud.... I believe that it has been
     the faith of this remarkable book never to have had more
     than a single reader. I myself am acquainted with it only in
     isolated chapters and scattered pages and paragraphs. But
     since my return to America, a young man of genius and
     enthusiasm has assured me that he has positively read the
     book from beginning to end, and is completely a convert to
     its doctrines. It belongs to him, therefore, and not to me,
     whom, in almost the last letter that I received from her,
     she declared unworthy to meddle with her work&mdash;it belongs
     surely to this one individual, who has done her so much
     justice as to know what she wrote, to place Miss Bacon in
     her due position before the public." ("Our Old Home.") The
     volume is obtained to-day, only by chance, in old bookshops
     and at such prices as the bookseller may choose to demand.
</pre>
    <p>
      It failed so utterly <span class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197"
      id="link197"></a>and miserably that nobody opened it, though that fact
      deterred nobody, of course, from laughing at it and its author to the
      utmost of their endeavor in ridicule and abuse. "Our American
      journalists," says Hawthorne, "at once republished some of the most brutal
      vituperations of the English press, thus pelting their poor countrywoman
      with stolen mud, without even waiting to know whether the ignominy was
      deserved, and they never have known it to this day, and never will." But
      none the less did Delia Bacon persevere to the end. The philosophy was
      unfolded. If the world declined to receive the truth&mdash;"the truth," as
      she claimed, "that is neither yours nor mine, but yours <i>and</i> mine"&mdash;it
      was not on her head, at least, that the consequences would fall. The
      second half of her work remained. She proceeded to Stratford to crown her
      labors, by opening the vault in the chancel of the parish church, and
      exposing the secret she had already guessed, to the doubting Thomasses who
      clamored for the tactual evidence so long entombed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although on a mission so likely to be regarded as predatory&mdash;as even
      coming under police prohibition, Miss Bacon seems to have lived in open
      avowal of her purpose, under the very shadows of the church she meant to
      despoil, and to have made nothing but friends. The regard was mutual, and,
      says Hawthorne, <span class="pagenum">198</span><a name="link198"
      id="link198"></a>"she loved the slumberous town, and awarded the only
      praise that I ever knew her to bestow on Shakespeare, the individual man,
      by acknowledging that his taste in selecting a residence was good, and
      that he knew how to choose a suitable retirement for a person of shy but
      genial temperament." She laid her plans before the vicar, who, so far as
      Miss Bacon ever was permitted to learn, never opposed them. * At least he
      did not hand her over to the first Dogberry at hand&mdash;a most
      un-English omission on his part. He did, however, ask Miss Bacon's leave
      to consult a friend, "who proved to be legal counsel," and who, doubtless,
      advised inaction, for the matter was allowed, so far as the lady was
      concerned, to retain the form of a pending negotiation with the parish,
      never, as a matter of fact, broken off on its part. The rest is best told
      in Mr. Hawthorne's dramatic narrative: "The affair looked certainly very
      hopeful. However erroneously, Miss Bacon had understood from the vicar
      that no obstacle would be interposed to the investigation, and that he
      himself would sanction it with his presence. It was to take place after
      nightfall; and, all preliminary arrangements being made, the vicar and the
      clerk professed to wait only her word, in order to set about lifting the
      awful stone from its sepulchre...
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  I cannot help fancying, however, that her familiarity
     with the events of Shakespeare's life, and of his death and
     burial (of which she would speak as if she had been present
     at the the edge of the grave), and all the history,
     literature, and personalities of the Elizabethan age,
     together with the prevailing power of her own belief, had
     really gone some little way toward making a convert of the
     good clergyman.&mdash;Hawthorne.

      She examined the surface of the gravestone, and en<span class="pagenum">199</span><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a>deavored, without stirring it, to estimate
      whether it were of such thickness as to be capable of containing the
      archives of the Elizabethan Club. She went over anew the proofs, the
      clews, the enigmas, the pregnant sentences, which she had discovered in
      Bacon's letters and elsewhere.... She continued to hover around the
      church, and seems to have had full freedom of entrance in the day-time,
      and special license, on one occasion at least, at a late hour at night.
      She went thither with a dark lantern, which could but twinkle like a
      glow-worm through the volume of obscurity that filled the great, dusky
      edifice. Groping her way up the aisle, and toward the chancel, she sat
      down on the elevated part of the pavement above Shakespeare's grave. She
      made no attempt to disturb the grave, though, I believe, she looked
      narrowly into the crevices between Shakespeare's and the two adjacent
      stones, and in some way satisfied herself that her single strength would
      suffice to lift the former, in case of need. She threw the feeble rays of
      her lantern up toward the bust, but could not make it visible beneath the
      darkness of the vaulted roof.... Several times she heard a low movement in
      the aisle; a stealthy, dubious footfall prowling about in the darkness,
      now here, now there, among the pillars and ancient tombs, as if some
      restless inhabitant of the latter had crept forth to peep at the intruder.
      By and by the clerk made his appearance, and confessed that he had been
      watching her ever since she entered the church. This was the nearest she
      came to the overt act, all thought of which was finally abandoned; for,
      meanwhile, worn out with the absorbing mental activity of these last
      years, and her physical privations (she had only ar<span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a>rived in Stratford in a condition so
      feeble and prostrated as to have believed herself beyond any necessity of
      providing any further earthly sustenance; the failure of her book and the
      miscarriage of her plans did the rest), she finally consented to be borne
      back to her home to die peacefully at the last, among friends. Her life
      and her "theory" are only to be discussed together, and both with
      tenderness. "Was there ever a more wonderful phenomenon?" exclaims
      Hawthorne&mdash;"a system of philosophy, growing up in this woman's mind,
      without her volition, contrary, in fact, to the determined resistance of
      her volition, and substituting itself in the place of everything that
      originally grew there! To have based such a system on fancy, and
      unconsciously elaborated it for herself, was almost as wonderful as really
      to have found it in the plays... it certainly came from no inconsiderable
      depth somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, so far as she herself put it on paper, Miss Delia Bacon's
      theory. It is to be carefully noticed, however, that it is a theory, not
      of a unitary but of a joint authorship. There is one passage in the
      "Putnam's Magazine" article (which at that time was announced by the
      publishers as the first of a series of papers, and was so intended by Miss
      Bacon) which points to Bacon as the supposed sole author of the plays.
      But, in the book which followed it, these plays are repeatedly assigned to
      a conclave or junta of Elizabethan courtiers and scholars, and such was
      the faith, we believe, in which Miss Bacon labored and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unitary theory, we believe not unfairly, may be assigned to Messrs.
      Smith and Holmes; the latter of whom, in the preface to his work, most
      distinctly <span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201" id="link201"></a>rejects
      Miss Bacon's "junta" authorship, and undertakes to maintain the
      proposition that Bacon, and Bacon alone, was the author of the whole canon
      of "Shakespeare." According to Judge Holmes, Bacon had reasons in plenty
      for concealing his authorship, and for "loving better to be a poet than to
      be accounted one." Not only his personal safety:&mdash;Dr. Heywood was
      already in the tower for having incensed the Queen by an unlucky pamphlet
      dedicated to Essex; and "not long after this," says Holmes, "and while
      Essex is under arrest, and Bacon in sundry interviews with the Queen, is
      still interceding in his behalf, her Majesty brings up against him this
      affair of Dr. Hoywood's book, and also, as it would seem, distinctly
      flings at Bacon himself about 'a matter which grew from him, but went
      after about in other's names (in fact no other than the play Richard II.
      we have to-day)." But the development of his plans made concealment
      particularly desirable. Political rivals were watching jealously his every
      utterance. He is known to be a "concealed poet," so he prepares a masque
      or two for the queen's own eye and audience; but he alone, according to
      Judge Holmes, writes "Shakespeare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had the plays (says Mr. Furness) come down to us anonymously&mdash;had
      the labor of discovering the author been imposed upon future generations,
      we could have found no one of that day but Francis Bacon to whom to assign
      the crown. In this case it would have been resting now upon his head by
      almost common consent." It is well that this essential difference between
      the "Delia Bacon" and the "Baconian" theories should be emphasized here.

      HE English Renaissance Drama seems naturally to group itself into two
      grand divisions: the Elizabethan drama and&mdash;Shakespeare. There is
      nothing in the first which surprises: which impresses us as too abrupt a
      departure from the brutish coarseness and grossness of the middle age
      mummeries&mdash;"miracle plays" and "mysteries"&mdash;or as being too
      refined or elaborate for the groundlings who swaggered and swilled beer,
      or the lords and maids of honor who ogled and flirted in the contemporary
      barns called "play-houses" in the days of Elizabeth. But that the
      proprietor of one of these barns should have found it to his profit to
      have overshot the intelligence of his audience by creating a Hamlet, a
      Lear, Brutus, and Macbeth&mdash;the action of whose roles are intellectual
      rather than scenic&mdash;for his players, or an Ophelia, Isabella, or
      Catharine for the small boys employed to render his female parts, is an
      incongruity&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;which arrests our credulity at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost that the Shakespeareans propose to do&mdash;the utmost they
      attempt&mdash;is to make out William Shakespeare to have been an
      Elizabethan Dramatist. But the Elizabethan Dramatist was a man who catered
      to the Elizabethan play-goer. Greene, Peele, Lodge, Nash, and the rest,
      were Elizabethan Dramatists. But <span class="pagenum">203</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a>their names are only a catalogue to-day.
      If we happen to buy a set of their works at a bargain, at some old book
      sale, we may put them on our shelves; but we are not equal to the
      laborious task of reading them. The Shakespearean Drama is a thing apart.
      Its Dramatic form seems only an Incident; perfect as that Incident is,
      there is so much more in it that we find appealing to our hearts and
      intellects to-day, that we hesitate to ascribe it even to an Elizabethan
      Dramatist. The Baconian theory, as elaborated by Holmes, we understand to
      be that this element apart from the Dramatic, in these days is the
      key-note and explanation of the whole Shakespeare mystery, and leads to
      the discovery that "Shakespeare" was only a convenient name under which
      the popular ear was sought to be arrested by a Philosopher, who wrote in
      cipher, as it were, for a great purpose of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophical system contemplated by Francis Bacon&mdash;say the
      Baconians&mdash;was divided into two grand Divisions, the Didactic and the
      Historical. The first&mdash;its author (despairing of contemporary fame,
      or possibly distrustful of the permanence of the vernacular) locked up in
      the universal language of scholars, and left it by his testament to "the
      next ages." The other he chose to put into Dramatic form. The spirit,
      motive, theme, and purport of two great phenomena of English letters,
      synchronizing in date (the philosophical canon of Bacon and the dramatic
      canon of "Shakespeare,") are identical, and form together essentially one
      great body of philosophy and inductive science, and, therefore, must have
      had the one author. "It is a thing, indeed, if practiced professionally,
      of low repute; but if it be made a part of discipline, it <span
      class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204" id="link204"></a>is of
      excellent use&mdash;I mean stage playing." he says himself. And again:
      "Dramatic poetry is as history made visible." This Historical or
      preliminary division of the Philosophy did not need a dead, but a living
      language&mdash;the language of his race. This he left in English: and
      when, at the end, a broken, weak, despised old man&mdash;knowing himself
      only too well to be the meanest and weakest of his kind; but yet conscious
      of having, in a large sense, worked for the good of his fellow-men&mdash;he
      made no excuse or palliation, but only bespoke for himself and his life
      "men's charitable speeches."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if there was but one author for these two contemporary works, why not
      William Shakespeare as well as Francis Bacon? Why not ask the question,
      "Did William Shakespeare write Lord Bacon's works?" * as well as, "Did
      Lord Bacon write William Shakespeare's work?" While not within our scope
      to demonstrate the identical philosophy of the Novum Organum and the
      Shakespearean Drama&mdash;(a work to which Miss Bacon devoted her life&mdash;and
      whose demonstration has been followed by Judge Holmes)&mdash;it is
      property within that scope to examine, from the outside, the question
      whether, as matter of fact, William Shakespeare could have written either;
      or whether, from circumstantial evidence merely, Lord Bacon was thus, and
      in pursuance of a great purpose, actually the author of the Dramatic canon
      of "Shakespeare."

      How, aside from any <i>opinion</i> as to their value, beauty, or
      eloquence, there are two characteristics of <span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>the Shakespearean works which, under the
      calmest and most sternly judicial treatment to which they could possibly
      be subjected, are so prominent as to be beyond gainsay or neglect. These
      two characteristics are&mdash;1. The encyclopaedic universality of their
      information as to matters of fact; and, 2. The scholarly refinement of the
      style displayed in them. Their claim to eloquence and beauty of
      expression, after all, is a question of taste; and we may conceive of
      whole peoples&mdash;as, for example, the Zulus or the Ashantees&mdash;impervious
      to any admiration for the Shakesperean plays on that account. But this
      familiarity with what, at their date, was the Past of history, and&mdash;up
      to that date&mdash;the closed book of past human discovery and research
      which we call Learning; is an open and indisputable fact; and the
      New-Zealander who shall sit on a broken arch of London Bridge and muse
      over the ruins of British civilization, if he carry his researches back to
      the Shakespearean literature, will be obliged to find that its writer was
      in perfect possession of the scholarship antecedent to his own date, and
      of the accumulated learning of the world down to his own actual day.
      Moreover, this scholar would not be compelled to this decision only by a
      careful examination of the entire Shakespearean opera. He will be forced
      to so conclude on an examination of any one, or, at the most, of any given
      group of single plays. Let him open at random, and fall upon, let us say,
      the "Julius C√¶sar." *

      Even the artificial Alexander Pope (who, so far from being an
      over-estimator of the Shakes<span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a>pearean works, only, from the heights of
      his superior plane, admits them very grudgingly to a rank beside the works
      of Waller) was obliged to confess as much. "This Shakespeare," says Mr.
      Pope, "must have been very knowing in the customs, rites, and manners of
      antiquity. In 'Coriolanus' and 'Julius C√¶sar,' not only the spirit, but
      the manner of the Romans is exactly drawn; and still a nicer distinction
      is shown between the manners of the Romans in the time of the former and
      of the latter. No one is more a master of the poetical story, or has more
      frequent allusions to the various parts of it. Mr. Waller (who has been
      celebrated for this last particular) has not shown more learning in this
      way than Shakespeare," * But, if the New-Zealander be a philologist, he
      will scarcely need perusal of more than a Shakespearean page to arrive at
      this judgment. Wherever else the verdict of scholarship may err, the
      microscope of the philologist cannot err. Like the skill of the
      chirographical expert, it is infallible, because, just as the hand of a
      writer, however cramped, affected, or disguised, will unconsciously make
      its native character of curve or inclination, so the speech of a man will
      be molded by his familiarity, be it greater or less, with the studies,
      learning, tastes, and conceits of his own day, and by the models before
      him. He cannot unconsciously follow models that are unknown to him, or
      speak in a language he has never learned.

      corroboration of history, that they were only the forgeries of a
      precocious boy. To just as moral a certainty are the handiwork of the
      Elohist and the Jehovist discernible in the Hebrew Scriptures, and just as
      absolutely incapable of an alternative explanation are the ear-marks of
      the Shakespearean text. Hallam, whose eyes were never opened to the truth,
      and who lived and died innocent of any anti-Shakespearean theory (though
      he sighed for a "Shakespeare of heaven," turning in disgust from the
      "Shakespeare of earth," of whom only he could read in history), noticing
      the phases, unintelligible and improper except in the sense of their
      primitive roots, which occur so copiously in the plays, proceeds to say:
      "In the 'Midsummer-Night's Dream' these are much less frequent than in his
      later dramas; but here we find several instances. Thus, 'Things base and
      vile, holding no <i>quantity</i>' (for <i>value</i>) rivers that 'have
      overborne their <i>continents</i>' (the <i>continenti riva</i> of-Horace);
      '<i>compact</i> of imagination;' 'something of great <i>constancy</i>'
      (for <i>consistency</i>); 'sweet Pyramus <i>translated</i> there;' 'the
      law of Athens, which by no means we may <i>extenuate</i>,' etc. I have
      considerable doubts," continues Mr. Hallam, "whether any of these
      expressions would be found in the contemporary prose of Elizabeth's reign,
      which was less overrun with pedantry than that of her successor. Could
      authority be produced for Latinisms so forced, it is still not very likely
      that one who did not understand their proper meaning would have introduced
      them into poetry." *

      Young Chatterton deceived the most profound scholars of his day, and his

      fact, so soon to receive the mournful <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>social speech in those days, even in the
      highest walks of life&mdash;we happen to have very graphic accounts of
      Queen Elizabeth's sayings and retorts courteous (as, e. g., when she boxed
      Essex's ears and told him to go and be hanged)&mdash;it requires
      considerable credulity to assign this classic diction to a rustic
      apprentice from Stratford, who, at "about eighteen," begins his dramatic
      labors, fresh from the shambles, and with no hiatus for a college course
      between.

      Add to this the patent fact that the antique allusions in the plays "have
      not regard to what we may call 'school classics,' but to authors seldom
      perused but by profound scholars" * even to-day: and technical
      exploration, however far it proceeds beyond this in the Shakespearean
      text, can bring evidence only cumulative as to the result already
      obtained. But, if we pass from the technical structure to the material of
      the plays, we are confronted with the still more amazing discovery that,
      not only the lore of the past was at the service of their author, but that
      he had no less an access to secrets supposed to be locked in the very womb
      of Time, the discoveries of which, in the as yet distant future, were to
      immortalize their first <i>sponsors</i>.

     **  Though not, perhaps, universally now-a-days. The late
     John Elliotson declared that the circulation through the
     lungs had certainly been taught seventy years previously by
     Servetus, who was burned at the stake in 1553. Dr. Robert
     Willis asserts, in his "Life of Harvey," that the facts he
     used were familiarly known to most of his predecessors for a
     century previous. Izaak Walton states that Harvey got the
     idea of circulation from Walter Warner, the mathematician;
     and that eminent physician, John Hunter, remarks that
     Servetus first, and Realdus Columbus afterward, clearly
     announced the circulation of the blood through the lungs;
     and Cisalpinus, many years before Harvey, published, in
     three different works, all that was wanting in Servetus to
     make the circulation complete. Wotton says that Servetus was
     the first, as far as he could learn, who had a distinct idea
     of this matter. Even the Chinese were impressed with this
     truth some four thousand years before Europeans dreamed of
     it. Plato affirmed&mdash;"the heart being the knot of the veins,
     and the fountain from whence the blood arises and briskly
     circulates through all the members." This, however, rather
     adds to than lessens the strength of the argument drawn from
     finding the "discovery" in the plays.
</pre>
    <p>
      For example, Dr. Harvey does not announce&mdash;what is credited to him *&mdash;his
      discovery of the circulation of <span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a>the blood in the human system&mdash;until
      1619 (his book was not published until 1628), three years after William
      Shakespeare's death. But why need Dr. Harvey have resorted to vivisection
      to make his "discovery"? He need only have taken down his "Shakespeare."

      Harvey's discovery, however, is said to have been the theory of Galen,

      the circulation of the blood is distinctly alluded to; and, as to Galen

      any rate, as good, mouth-filling words, to be paid for at the lowest
      market price): * than to conceive a twelfth manager and proprietor of this
      home of the Muses, and whilom sticker of calves, after the day's labor,
      shunning his cups and the ribald mirth-making of those sad dogs, his
      fellow <span class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212" id="link212"></a>managers,
      to seek, in the solitude of his library and Greek manuscripts, the choice
      companionship of this same Galen and Paracelsus?

     * Shakespeare married a woman older than himself. Why-should
     he call attention to the fact, publish it to the rabble, or
     record it on his stage whenever he found opportunity?

     Heaven! Let still the woman take an elder than herself."
     Again&mdash;"Then let thy love be younger than thyself," etc.,
     etc. ("Twelfth Night," Act II., Scene 4.)

     It is very difficult to suppose that Shakespeare should have
     wantonly in public insulted his own wife (however he might
     snub her in private); though it is very easy to imagine his
     passing it over in another man's manuscript in hurried

      Newton, who was only born in 1642&mdash;twenty years after Shakespeare was
      laid away in his tomb&mdash;surely need not have lain under his appletree
      in the orchard at Woolsthorpe, waiting for the falling fruit to reveal the
      immutable truth of gravitation. He had but to take down his copy of
      "Troilus and Cressida" (printed in 1606) to open to the law itself, as
      literally stated as he himself could have formulated it:

      his evenings at home, after the play at the Globe was over, snugly in his
      library, out of hearing of the ribaldry of his fellows over their cups,
      stumbling upon the laws of the circulation of the blood and of
      gravitation, engrossing them "without blotting out a line," and sending
      the "copy" to the actors so that they could commit it to memory for the
      stage on the following evening?

      What a library it was&mdash;that library up among the flies (if they had

      over Galen and Paracelsus and Plato in the original Greek! It was miracle
      enough that the learned blacksmith at his forge, in the nineteenth century&mdash;surrounded
      with libraries, and when books could be had for the purchasing&mdash;could
      have mastered all the known languages. But that William Shakespeare, with
      only two terms at Stratford school, (or, let us say, twenty years at
      Stratford School, or at the University of Oxford&mdash;for there is as
      much evidence that he was at Oxford as that he was at Stratford school) <i>without</i>
      books, since there were no books purchasable, should have known every

      his poaching and his beer-bouting&mdash;were all the schooling William
      Shakespeare ever had, according to all bis biographies. (We say, all he
      ever had, because his father was so illiterate that he signed every thing
      with a mark, and so did his mother, and so did the rest of William's
      family; and the boy William was too busy at skylarking&mdash;according to
      those who knew him&mdash;to have had much opportunity of private
      instruction at the parental knee, even had the parental acquirements been
      adequate.) Were the theory and practice of the common law taught there?
      "Legal phrases flow from his pen," says Mr. Grant White, "as a part of his
      vocabulary and parcel of his thought.... This conveyancer's jargon ('fine
      and recovery,' 'tenure,' 'fee simple,' 'fee farm,' etc., etc.) could not
      have been picked up by hanging around the courts in London, two hundred
      and fifty years ago, when suits as to the title of real property were
      comparatively rare. And, besides, Shakespeare uses his law just as freely
      in his early plays, written in his first Loudon years, as in those
      produced at a later period." * And not only in the technique, but in the
      groundwork of that mighty and abstruse science, the law of England," is he
      perfect. A chief justice of England has declared that "while novelists and
      dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to the law of marriage, of
      wills, and of inheritance, to Shakespeare's law, lavishly as he expounded
      it, there can neither be demurrer, nor bill of exceptions, nor writ of
      error." **

      advanced knowledge of the present day. And not only in the general
      knowledge of a lawyer and a physician, but in what we call in these days
      "medical jurisprudence," the man that wrote the historical play of Henry
      IV. seems to have been an expert. Mr. David Paul Brown ** says that in
      "Frost's case" (a cause celebre of his day), on a trial for murder, the

      All the arts, sciences, and literatures must have been mastered by our
      sleepless Shakespeare, either at Stratford school, or in the midst of his
      London career, when operating two theaters, reading plays for his stage,
      editing them, engrossing the parts for his actors, and acting himself.
      (And Mr. Cohn will have it that in these unaccounted-for times, he had
      visited Germany with his troupe and performed in all its principal cities,
      coining money as he went.) ** Mr. Brown, Dr. Bell, and others, announce
      that they believe that these travels of his extended to Italy, and Mr.
      Thoms and Mr. Cohn, to some extent, account for Shakespeare on the
      continent, by believing that, instead of going at once to London, when
      fleeing from Stratford before Sir Thomas Lucy, he enlisted under Leicester
      for the Netherlands in 1585, but left the ranks for the more lucrative
      career of an actor. But these theories only crowd still more thickly the
      brief years in which the great works (which are, after all, what the world
      regards in these investigations), appeared.

      The classical course conducted by Hunt and Jenkins must have been far more
      advanced than is common in our modern colleges, in Columbia or Harvard,
      for example. For not only did Rowe and Knight find traces in "Shakespeare"
      of the Electra of Sophocles, Colman of Ovid, Farmer of Horace and Virgil,
      Steevens of Plautus, and White of Euripides, which are read today in those
      universities; but Pope found traces of Dares and Phrygius, and Malone of
      Lucretius, Status and Catullus, which are not ordinarily used as textbooks
      to-day in our colleges.

      The name and character of "Imogen" is derived from an Italian novel not
      then&mdash;and perhaps not how&mdash;translated into English. Tschischwitz
      finds in "Hamlet" the philosophy of Giordano Bruno, professor at
      Wittemberg in 1583-86. All these are no stumbling-blocks to those who
      adhere to the Baconian authorship.

      But, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Latin aside, was English taught at
      Stratford school? If it were, it would have been the most wonderful of
      all, for, as a matter of fact in those days, and for many long years
      thereafter, English was a much snubbed acquirement. The idea of education
      was to read, talk, and quote Latin, Greek, and the dead languages, the
      child was put to his "accidence." instead of his horn-book, and scholars
      scorned to spend much time on their own vernacular. But even should we
      concede that it was genius that made the village boy master of a diction
      the grandest of which his mother tongue was capable, there is a greater
      difficulty beyond, over which <span class="pagenum">218</span><a
      name="link218" id="link218"></a>the concession will not lift us. This
      difficulty has been so succinctly stated by Mr. Grant White, in his "Essay
      Toward the Expression of Shakespeare's Genius," that we can not do better
      than quote his words. "It was only in London that those plays could have
      been written. London had but just before Shakespeare's day made its
      metropolitan supremacy felt as well as acknowledged throughout England. As
      long as two hundred years after that time the county of each member of
      Parliament was betrayed by his tongue..... Northumberland, or Cornwall, or
      Lancashire might have produced Shakespeare's mind; but had he lived in any
      one of those counties, or in another, like them remote in speech as in
      locality from London, and written for his rural neighbors instead of for
      the audiences of the Blackfriars and the Globe, the music of his poetry
      would have been lost in sounds uncouth and barbarous to the general ear,
      the edge of his fine utterance would have been turned upon the stony
      roughness of his rustic phraseology. His language would have been a
      dialect which must needs have been translated to be understood by modern
      English ears." * As Mr. White wrote these words, did it not occur to him
      that, by his own chronology, ** this Warwickshire rustic came to London
      with "Venus and Adonis" in his pocket, and began, almost immediately, the
      production of plays, not in the Warwickshire dialect, which he had grown
      up in from his birth, but in a diction that needs no translating "to be
      understood by modern English ears?"

      music through the alembic of his genius. When, later in life, he essayed
      to write in metropolitan English, says Principal Shairp, "he was seldom
      more than a third-rate&mdash;a common clever versifier." * But this
      uncouth Warwickshire rustic writes, as his first essay in English
      composition, the most elegant verses the age produced, and which for
      polish and care surpass his very latest works! Every step in the received
      Shakespeare's life appears to have been a miracle: for, according to them,
      the boy Shakespeare needed to be taught nothing, but was born versed in
      every art, tongue, knowledge, and talent, and did every thing without
      tuition or preparation.

      conceives either their wealth of exact reference to the minutest features
      of the lands or the localities in which their actions lie, or the
      conclusions to be drawn therefrom. There were no guide-books or
      itineraries of Venice published until after William Shakespeare had ceased
      writing for the stage: and yet, while schoolboy facts&mdash;such as that
      Venice is built in the sea, or that gondolas take the place of wheeled
      vehicles, or that there is a leaning tower at Pisa, or a coliseum at
      Verona or Rome&mdash;are not referred to (the out-door action in "Othello"

      matters (such as a mere tourist, however he might have observed, would
      scarcely have found of enough interest to mention to his neighbors on
      returning home), are familiarly and incidentally alluded to, making the
      phenomena of all this familiarity with Italy quite too prominent to be
      overlooked. A poet like Samuel Rogers writes a poem on Italy. All that is
      massive, venerable, and sublime; all that touches his heart as pitiful, or
      appeals to his nature as sensuous and romantic, goes down in his poem. The
      scenes Mr. Rogers depicts are those which crowd most upon the cultivated
      tourist to-day&mdash;the past of history that must stir the soul to
      enthusiasm. But here are plays, written before the days of guide-books
      (and if there had been any such things, they would have enlarged upon the
      same features that Mr. Rogers did), which are at home in the unobserved
      details which the fullest Murray or Baedeker find it unnecessary to
      mention. Portia sends her servant Balthazar to fetch "notes and garments"
      of her learned cousin, Bellario, and to meet her at the "common ferry
      which trades to Venice." There are two characters named "Gobbo" in the
      play&mdash;a frequent Venetian name in a certain obscure walk, and one
      which a mere tourist would be most unlikely to meet with. Othello brings
      Desdemona from her father's house to his residence in the "Sagittary." In
      "Two Gentlemen of Verona," Valentine is made to <i>embark</i> at Verona
      for Milan, and in "Hamlet," Baptista is used as the name of a woman. Both
      of these latter were sneered at as mistakes for some hundred years, <span
      class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221" id="link221"></a>until one
      learned German discovers that Baptista is not uncommonly used as a woman's
      name in Italy, * and another learned German that, in the sixteenth
      century, Milan and Verona were actually connected by canals, ** with which
      the surface of Italy was intersected! etc., etc. Dr. Elze was made a
      careful collation of these instances (which need not detain us here except
      by way of reference), in an essay on the supposed travels of Shakespeare,
      wherein he, from the same internal evidence, regards it certain that the
      writer (William Shakespeare he calls him), not only visited Italy, but
      Scotland, absorbing all he saw with the same microscopical exactness.

      And were the modern languages also taught by this myriad-minded Jenkins?
      Mr. Grant White says emphatically, No! "Italian and French, we may be
      sure, were <i>not</i> taught at Stratford school." *** And yet William
      Shakespeare borrowed copiously from Boccaccio, Cinthio, and Belleforest.

      trash," etc., is a perfect paraphrase of a stanza in Berni's "Orlando
      Innamorato," of which poem, says Mr. White, to this day (1864) there is no

      startingly like.1 And yet Mr. White clings to his Stratford school, where
      "Beeston" told Aubrey that William Shakespeare was once a school-master.
      Perhaps Mr. White refuses to be converted because he has discovered that
      Dr. Farmer discovered that, when, in the "Taming of the Shrew," Tranio
      quotes Terence, "he is inaccurate, and gives the passage, not as it
      appears in the text of the Latin dramatist, but as it is misquoted in the
      Latin grammar of William Lily; a school-book in common use among our
      forefathers when William Shakespeare was a boy." ** But (though somebody
      has suggested that William might have risen to be "head boy" at Stratford
      grammar school; and been, in that capacity, intrusted with hearing the
      lessons of the smaller boys, whence the school-master story may have
      arisen), the Beestou story has been rejected by all the commentators with
      a unanimity of which, we believe, it is the only instance, in case of a
      Shakespearean detail. So far as we know, there has been but one effort to
      prove that William Shakespeare was a university man. ***

      A small type, called nonpareil, was introduced into English printing
      houses from Holland about the year 1650, and became admired and preferred
      beyond the others in common use. It seems to have become a favorite type
      with Shakespeare, who calls many of his lady characters "Nonpareils."
      Prospero calls his daughter "a Nonpareil." (Tempest, Act III, Scene 2d)
      Olivia, in "Twelfth Night," is the "Nonpareil of Beauty" (Act I, Scene 5),
      and in Cymbeline, Posthumous is made to call Imogen the "Nonpareil of her
      time" (Act II, Scene 5).

      When a certain number of pages of type have been composed they are placed
      in an iron frame called a "chase," laid upon an "imposing" stone, a piece
      of beveled wood, called a "sidestick," is placed beside the pages, and
      small wedges of beveled hard wood, called "coigns," or "quoins," are
      tightly driven in, holding the pages firmly in their places, and making a
      compact "form." Surely there is an allusion to this in Pericles III, 1.

      Punctuation is a fruitful source of misunderstanding between an author and
      his printer. Very few authors punctuate their manuscript as they would
      wish to see it in the print, and fewer yet are apt to be good natured and
      satisfied when the printer punctuates for them. William Shakespeare may
      have remembered this when he wrote:

      it is hard to be persuaded that direct allusion is not <span
      class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>made to the
      English custom (which still obtains, as any body may see for himself by
      opening a book printed&mdash;wherever published&mdash;in England) of
      placing the typographer's imprint upon the vacant or extra leaf or leaves&mdash;where
      the text runs short, at the end of the volume; just as, if an American
      publisher, who buys a hundred copies of an English work, may stipulate to
      have his imprint put upon the title-page (or, perhaps, print his own
      title-page in this country), the last page of the book itself will
      invariably reveal whether the actual manufacture was in England or not; an
      analogy which implies technical information. An image employed by Othello,
      who takes his wife's hand in his, and says,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Here's a young and sweating devil."

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      is, Mr. Blades thinks, misunderstood. If his wife's palm was the
      messenger, as Othello suspected, of her desires to Cassio, there would be
      some propriety&mdash;from a printer's standpoint&mdash;in calling it "a
      devil," for a printer's "devil" is his messenger or errand boy: though
      another meaning is not so far fetched in sound to a non-professional.

      We have mentioned that the Stationer's Company was a fraternity composed
      only of monopolists, each of whom had a monopoly, from the crown, of the
      printing of certain books. It was a part of their duty to give notice of
      this monopoly upon every impression of the book, precisely as the notice
      of copyright entry is obliged by law to be printed to-day upon copyrighted
      books. The entry was to be expressed, after the printer's name, or at
      least, conspicuously on the <span class="pagenum">227</span><a
      name="link227" id="link227"></a>title-page, in the formula, "<i>cum
      privil√©gia ad imprimendum solum;</i>" and as the formula was to be
      incessantly used it was undoubtedly "kept standing" in the composing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to notice, in the "Taming of the Shrew," Act iv., Scene 4,
      the recurrence of this formula in a speech of Biondello:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bion.</i> I can not tell; except they are busied about a counterfeit
      assurance; take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad im-primendum solum
      to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be noticed that the word "counterfeit" in the above speech, was a
      printer's term in those days; and, used in the printer's technical sense,
      would be applicable; for Biondello is counseling Lucertio to marry Bianca
      out of hand, and without waiting for her father and his counselor who are
      discussing the marriage treaty. A "counterfeit" was a reprint (as we would
      say now, a "reprint in fac-simile"). *

      Again: it might be supposed that a country lad should know the ways of
      dogs and birds and beasts and creeping things. But it happens to be human
      experience that the country lad is the least likely person to turn out a
      naturalist. It is much more probable that some over-worked shoemaker, in
      some rare escape from his city garret, should find his thoughts awakened
      by watching an ant-hill, and succeed in years in making himself an
      entomologist; than that the farmer's boy, who catches bugs every day to
      bait his fish-hook, should turn out an entomolo<span class="pagenum">228</span><a
      name="link228" id="link228"></a>gist; just as it is not the farmer's
      daughter, but the fashionable young lady from town who tramps the fields
      and tears her hands for wild-flowers or wets her feet for the pond lilies.
      But whoever wrote the plays had found time to learn all the ways of these.
      Says Bottom, to Cobweb, the fairy, in "Midsummer Wight's Bream,"
      "Monsieur, get your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped
      bumblebee on the top of a thistle." In the United States as well as
      England, there is no more likely place to find a bumblebee in midsummer
      than on a thistle. In "Much Ado about Nothing," Benedict says to Margaret
      "Thy wit is as quick as a greyhound's mouth. It catches." The peculiarity
      of a greyhound is that, unlike other dogs, it is able to catch game in its
      mouth as it runs; other hounds must stop to do this. In "As You Like It,"
      Celia tells Rosalind that Monsieur Le Beau, who comes with his mouth full
      of news, will feed it to them "as pigeons feed their young," and Rosalind
      replies, "Then we shall be news crammed." Pigeons bring food to their
      young in their crops, and cram it down their young ones' throats, as no
      other birds do. In "Twelfth Night" the clown tells Viola that "fools are
      as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings&mdash;the husband's the
      bigger." The pilchard closely resembles the herring, but is thicker and
      heavier, with larger scales. In the same play Maria says of Malvolio,
      "Here comes the trout which must be caught with tickling." Expert anglers
      know that by gently tickling a trout's sides and belly, it can be so
      mesmerized as to be taken out of the water with the hand. In "As you Like
      It," we have the lines "For look where Beatrice, like the lapwing, runs
      close by the ground to hear our confer<span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a>ence." The lapwing is a kind of plover
      which is very swift of foot and which, when trying to avoid being seen,
      keeps its head close to the ground as it runs. Says Lear's fool, "The
      hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long that it had its head bit off by its
      young." The hedge-sparrow in England is a favorite bird for the cuckoo to
      impose its young upon. In "All's Well that Ends Well," Lafeu says of
      Farolles "I took this lark for a bunting." The English bunting is a field
      bird of the same form and color as the lark, but inferior as a singer. And
      so the figures are always accurate, "the ousel-cock so black of hue," "the
      throstle with his note so true," "the wren with little quill," "the
      russet-pated chough, rising and cawing at the guns report." And so of
      flowers, as when Perdita speaks of

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      the writer knew that in England the daffodil blooms in February and March,
      while the swallow never appears until April. In none of the allusions to
      nature or natural phenomena in the plays, is there any such thing as guess
      work. * Now, what was the necessity for all this technical, geographical,
      botanical, and occult learning, in a simple drama thrown off by an
      Elizabethan dramatist, earning his living by catering to an Elizabethan
      audience? It was not only unnecessary, but almost fatal to his success.
      The Elizabethan audience did not want scientific treatises.

      That Shakespeare borrowed Greene's famous "sea-coast" is a point either
      way. If he took it supposing that Bohemia had a sea-coast, the omnipotent
      knowledge assigned him by his worshipers failed him at least once. And if
      he knew (as is now claimed, though on what authority we know not), that
      Bohemia once possessed provinces on the Adriatic, he knew, as usual, what
      the acute research of three hundred years has only just developed. And was
      agriculture taught at this Stratford school, and politics and the art of
      war?1 And was there any thing that William Shakespeare did not know? We
      are entitled to ask these questions, for it must be remembered that,
      before the appearance of the Shakespearean dramas, there was practically
      no literature written in the English tongue. To use the words of Macauley,
      "A person who did not read Latin and Greek could read nothing, or next to
      nothing.... The Italian was the only modern language which possessed any
      thing that could be called a literature." ** One possessing, then, merely
      "small Latin and less Greek," could not have written "Shakespeare." Still
      less could he have written it out of Gower and Chaucer, and the <span

      But if the Stratford grammar-school confined its teachings to the pages of
      the English bible alone, it worked wonders, for Bishop Wadsworth goes so
      far as to declare, that "take the entire range of English literature&mdash;put
      together our best authors, who have written on subjects not professedly
      religious, and we shall not find, I believe, in them all, printed so much
      evidence of the Bible being read and used, as in Shakespeare alone." * Yet
      William Shakespeare had little opportunity for self-education, except
      these two terms at Stratford school; he was a lad-of-all-work at the
      Bankside Theater, when a mere child. He was only fifty-two years old when
      he died. He was one of several partners in certain theatrical
      establishments in London, in the years when he must have put all this
      multitudinous learning, he had carried in his head so long, on paper. He
      was so active, industrious, and shrewd in those years, that he alone of
      the partners was able to retire with a fortune&mdash;to purchase lands and
      a grant of arms for his father (whence he himself might become an esquire
      by descent); and, in the years of leisure after his retirement, he wrote
      only three or four epitaphs, which no other graduate of Stratford school
      would probably have cared to claim.

      The Baconian theory is simply that, so far as the records of the
      Elizabethan period are accessible, there was but one man in England, at
      the date at which this Shakespearean literature appeared, who could have
      produced it. * The history of Bacon's life, his massive acquirements, his
      profound scholarship even as a child: his advantages of foreign travel,
      his ambitious acquaintance with the court: and, joined to all, his dire
      necessities and his successive retirements (the dates of which, when
      collated, coincide with the dates at which the plays&mdash;tallying in
      matter with the circumstantial surroundings of Bacon's life as, for
      example, Shylock appeared at about the time when Bacon was most helplessly
      in the toils of what he calls "the Lombardo"):&mdash;all this need not be
      recapitulated here. He was born and bred in the atmosphere of libraries.
      While William Shakespeare was poaching on Avon banks, the little Francis
      was impressed with the utter inadequacy of Aristotle's method to grapple
      with <span class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a>modern
      needs, and meditating its superseding with labors of his own.

      The gray-haired Queen, who in youth had called him her little Lord Keeper,
      will not lift a hand to aid him in his poverty, or to advance him in the
      State, regarding him as a man of study rather than of practice and
      experience; and so Bacon is known to have remained, bemoaning (as he
      himself says in a letter to Burleigh, written in 1592) "the meanness of my
      [his] estate; for though I can not accuse myself that I am either prodigal
      or slothful, yet my health is not to spend, nor my course to get." * This
      is the very year, 1592, in which Robert Greene "discovers that a new poet
      has arisen who is becoming the only shake-scene in a county;" and so far
      forgets himself as to become "jealous" of "William Shakespeare, who, up to
      this time, has only been a "Johannes Factotum," of not much account until
      he borrows "our feathers." ** And so, until 1611, Bacon is driven to the
      Jews. Why should he not, in his pressing necessity for "lease of quick
      revenue," bethink him of the resources within himself, and seek a cover
      whereunder&mdash;without embarrassing his hope of future preferment&mdash;he
      may turn into gold his years of study and travel, by means of a quick pen?
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1611, when he is suddenly created attorney-general, the Shakespearean
      plays cease abruptly, to appear no more for ever. William Shakespeare
      closes out his theatrical interest in London, and retires, to moneylending
      (as some say), in Stratford. He dies in 1616.

      Lord Bacon reaches his highest pinnacle of greatness, <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>and falls, in 1621. In 1623, while Bacon
      is again spending his time in the strictest privacy and retirement, there
      suddenly appears a folio, "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare,"
      amended, revised, enlarged, and improved, including at least seventeen
      (Mr. Smith says twenty-three) plays which had never appeared or been heard
      of in Shakespeare's lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of us&mdash;outside the ranks of commentators, like Mr. Grant White,
      and others, who give their valuable lives to this study&mdash;dream how
      vast were the emendations and revisions, enlargements and corrections of
      the old Shakespearean plays given to the world in this folio of 1623. Mr.
      White says that in the one play of "Love's Labours Lost" there are
      inserted newlines in almost every speech.1 Another, "The Merry Wives of
      Windsor," according to Knight, ** has double the number of lines it
      originally possessed in 1600. The "Henry V." has nineteen hundred new
      lines. The "Titus Andronicus" has an entire scene added, and the "Much Ado
      about Nothing" and "The Lear" are so altered and elaborated, with
      curtailment here and enlargement there, as to lead Mr. Knight to declare
      that "none but the hand of the master could have superadded them." ***
      But, if William Shakespeare was the "master," how did his hand reach up
      out of the grave under Stratford chancel, where it had rested seven years,
      to make these improvements?

      And if William Shakespeare in his lifetime made those revisions for
      Heminges and Condell (who appear on the title-page of this folio of 1623
      as editors, and an<span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235"
      id="link235"></a>nounce in the preface that this edition is printed from
      the "true original copies") at Stratford (where, according to his own
      inventory, he had neither library nor books&mdash;nor bookcase, nor
      writing table, for that matter), why did he not print them himself, for
      his own benefit, instead of performing all this labor of emendation for
      somebody else? He could not have been fearful lest he would lose money by
      them, for they had been the foundation and source of all his fortune. Nor
      had he grown, in his old age, indifferent to gain (let the ghost of the
      poor "delinquent for malt delivered" assure us of that!). He could not
      have revised them for pure glory: for, in his previous career, while in
      London, he had shown no interest in them, permitting them to be
      surreptitiously printed by whoever, in the same town with himself, listed
      so to do. He had even allowed them to be mixed up with other people's
      trash, his name signed to all indifferently, and the whole made footballs
      of by the London printers, under his very nose, without so much as lifting
      a voice in protest, or to declare which were his and which were not. *
      Besides, if he had revised them for the glory of his own name, why did he
      not cause them to be printed? Nor can we suppose that he was employed to
      revise them, for pay, by Heminges and Condell, because, if they did so
      employ him, why did they carry the expense of the revision for seven long
      years, until he and his wife were both in their graves, before reimbursing
      themselves by printing the first folio for the market!

      Last, and most wonderful <span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236"
      id="link236"></a>of all, in this first folio are included all these
      entirely new plays which had never been heard of before! Who wrote those,
      and why? The answer to these riddles, the Baconians say, is that, when
      again at leisure, Bacon bethought himself of his scattered progeny, and&mdash;whether
      proposing to publicly own them or not&mdash;whether to secure them for
      posterity or merely for his own pastime&mdash;he devoted that leisure to a
      revision of the works by means of which he had bridged the first long
      interval in his career. At any rate, when the revision appeared, it is
      matter of fact that William Shakespeare was dead and in his grave, and
      speculation has nothing to do with that.

    <p>
      Besides the coincidence of the plays appearing during Bacon's first
      retirement: ceasing altogether at his first elevation, and appearing in
      revised and improved form again after his final downfall, and during his
      second privacy, the Baconians cite: I. Contemporary statements, which
      include (A), Sir Tobie Matthew's famous postscript: * "The most prodigious
      wit of these times is of your name, though he be known by another" (which
      Mr. Weiss ** explains, very lamely in our opinion, by arguing that the <i>other</i>
      name by which Bacon was known, and to which Matthew alludes, was "<i>Viscount
      St. Albans</i>); (B), a letter from Bacon
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Bacon was in the habit of sending certain of his lighter
     manuscripts to Sir Tobie, and this postscript was appended
     to a letter acknowledging the receipt of Bacon's "great and
     esteemed favor of the 9th of April."

      to Sir John Davies, who is going to meet the new king James (with whom
      Bacon is striving for favor, looking to his own preferment), in which he
      commits to Sir John's "faithful care and discretion" his interests at
      court, and adds, "So, asking you to be good to concealed poets, I
      continue," etc., etc.; * II. Evidence by way of Innuendo, including
      another of Matthew's postscripts (the one in which he writes to Bacon, "I
      will not return you weight for weight, but measure for measure," etc.);
      also, perhaps, the injunctions of secrecy in Bacon's own letters to
      Matthew, to "be careful of the writings submitted to you, that no one see
      them." There is, besides, in many of Bacon's preserved letters something
      suggestive of a "curious undermeaning, impressing the reader with an idea
      of more than appears on the surface." The idea of the stage, as a figure
      of speech, occurs in a letter to the Queen: "Far be it from me to stage
      myself," etc.; and in one to lady Buckingham, "I do not desire to stage
      myself but for the comfort of a private life," etc. "Dramatic poesy," he
      declares, "is as history made visible." Writing to Matthew, he refers to a
      "little work of my recreation;" and Matthew, in return, banters him on
      writing many things "under another name." This is in 1609, and no more
      "Shakespeare" plays appear until Othello, in 1621. The Jonson obituary
      verse&mdash;in which occur the encomiums so rung in our ears by the
      Shakespeareans (and which we have&mdash;earlier in these pages&mdash;seen

      III. The Parallelisms. That is to say, an almost identity of phraseology,
      found in both the Baconian and Shakespearean writings. The best list of
      these is to be found in Judge Holmes' book, covering some twenty-five
      closely-printed pages. ** Of the value of this latter class of evidence,
      it is for every reader to judge for himself; but that a writer of exact
      science and moral philosophy should plagiarize from the theater, or the
      theater from the writer of exact science and moral philosophy; or (still
      more improbable) that two contemporary authors, in the full glare of the
      public eye, should select each other's works to habitually and regularly
      plagiarize upon, are altogether, it seems to the Baconians, out of the
      question.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  It is curious to find the Baconians appealing to this
     "best evidence" for the other side. But they read it as an
     Innuendo. For example, the verses&mdash;

     "Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage Or
     influence, cheer the crooping stage!

     Which&mdash;since thy flight from hence, hath-mourned like night
     And despaired day&mdash;but for thy volume's light&mdash;"
     they say, do not and can not, refer to William Shakespeare
     at all. For this was published in 1623, and William
     Shakespeare had been dead seven years. He could not "shine
     forth" again, except figuratively, in his volume, and this
     he already does by the publication of his works, and is
     admitted to do in the next line, where it is said that but
     for "thy volume's light" the stage would "mourn in night."
     The Baconians, who believe that Ben Jonson himself was the
     "Heminges and Condell" who edited the first folio, regarded
     this whole poem as a sop to Bacon, on Ben Jonson's part.

      But even the conceiving of so unusual a state of affairs as a political
      philosopher and playwright contracting together to mutually plagiarize
      from each other's writ<span class="pagenum">239</span><a name="link239"
      id="link239"></a>ings would hardly account for the coincidence between the
      cottage scene (Act IV, Scene 3) in "A Winter's Tale," and Bacon's "Essay
      on Gardens," in which he maintained that "there ought to be gardens for
      all the months of the year; in which severally things of beauty may be in
      their season," which he proceeds to suggest:

      assured that the prose in the left-hand column was the poet's first rough
      notes for the exquisite poetry in the second, would there be any internal
      evidence for doubting it? And when it appears that "The Essay on Gardens"
      was not printed until 1625, nine years after William Shakespeare's death
      and burial, and two years after an edition of his alleged plays, rewritten
      and revised, had appeared (when so deliberate a "steal" would hardly be
      profitable), the exoteric evidence seems at least to command attention.

      A coincidence between a passage in "The Advancement of Learning" and in
      the play of "Troilus and Cressida," Act II., Scene 2 (which, we shall see

      1609, thereafter, within a few months, to be reissued as by William
      Shakespeare *&mdash;who was not, at the date of that edition, either a
      novice or a first appearance), is worth pausing to tabulate:

      &mdash;or, finding it already in, should not have a sufficient
      acquaintance with Aristotle to scent an impropriety and take it out&mdash;is
      no less or no more absurd than that a philosopher, in composing so
      profound and weighty an essay as the "Advancement of Learning," should go
      to a cheap play-house for his reference to the Greek sage. If Bacon <i>did</i>
      attend the theater that night to learn the opinion of Aristotle (whom he
      had criticised at college at the age of fifteen) on young blood and
      philosophy, he was misled, for Aristotle said not that young men ought not
      to <i>hear moral</i>, but ought not to <i>study political</i> philosophy.
      And the error itself is proof positive&mdash;it seems to the Baconians&mdash;of
      an identical source for the two passages. It must not be forgotten,
      however, that the evidence from these coincidences is cited not to an
      Anti-Shakespearean case&mdash;which is purely historical&mdash;but as
      cumulative to the Baconian case alone. And yet, though the evidence from
      the "parallelisms" is the least forcible of any presented by the
      Baconians, so systematically do they occur that the ablest Baconian writer
      (Judge Holmes) claims that he has been able to reduce them to an ordo, and
      to know precisely where to expect them, by reference merely to a history
      of the life of Lord Bacon, and the date of the production. "When I got
      your 'Letters and Life of Bacon," he writes to Mr. Spedding, "and read
      that fragment of a masque; having the dates of all the plays in my mind, I
      felt quite sure at once in which I should find that same matter, if it
      appeared anywhere (as I expected it would) and went first straight to the
      'Midsummer-Night's Dream,' and there came upon it, in the second <span
      class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242" id="link242"></a>act, so
      palpably and unmistakably that I think nothing else than a miracle could
      shake my belief in it."1 The facts that Lord Bacon expressed himself to
      the effect that the best way of teaching history was by means of the
      drama; that there is a connected and continuous series of historical plays
      (covering by reigns the entire period of the War of the Roses), in the
      Shakespearean drama from 'King John,' by way of prelude&mdash;in which the
      legitimate heir to the throne is set aside, and the nation plunged into
      civil war&mdash;to 'Richard III.' where the two roses are finally united
      in one line in Henry VI., and winding up with the reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;wherein,
      as a grand finale to the whole, the splendor of the new line is shown in
      its reunited vigor"&mdash;which (with but one hiatus, the missing reign of
      Henry VII.) is one complete cycle of English history: and that, on
      searching among the remains of Francis Bacon, a manuscript "History of
      Henry VII." is found, which might well be the minutes for a future drama
      (the opening paragraph of which seems to be a recapitulation of the last
      scene of the Richard III. of the dramas), is certainly startling. Not
      necessarily connected with this discovery is the further fact that Mr.
      Spodding has found, in the library of Northumberland house, among certain
      of Bacon's manuscripts, a slip of paper, upon which is scrawled eight
      times, in a clerky hand (not Bacon's), the name "William Shakespeare,"
      together with the names of certain of the known Shakespearian Historical
      plays, and of certain (as Judge Holmes conjectures) other plays not now

      Henry Chettle, in 1603, in his "England's Mourning Garment (a rhyme),"
      wonders that "Melicert does not drop a single sable tear" over the death
      of "Our Elizabeth." It might, indeed, seem strange had William Shakespeare
      (supposing these lines to apply to him) been the favorite he is said to
      have been with Elizabeth. But, while neither Shakespeare nor Bacon sing
      mortuary strains, of the two (if these stories about Elizabeth's love for
      Shakespeare are true) it is certainly not strange that Bacon did not; for
      Bacon, at least, had no cause to idolize his queen.

      Ben Jonson's eulogies of Shakespeare, in verse, nowhere surpass, as we
      have seen, his eulogies of Bacon, in prose. He calls Lord Bacon "the acme

      acmes."

      "On every variety of court enfolding," continues that writer, "was Bacon
      daily employed, writing in others' names; and, if we do not think worse of
      Plato for personating Socrates, or of Cicero for personating Cato,"
      neither should ill be thought of Bacon for borrowing a name "to cover his
      aim," etc.2 Meanwhile, "this acme of our language 'was poor and a
      borrower." In 1605, is published an anonymous pamphlet, called "Ratsei's

      "If this satirical passage," says Mr. Thompson, "plainly alludes to him
      who went to London very meanly, and came, in time, to be exceedingly

      <i>acting</i>, not by writing, plays, and by usury." *

      As to Miss Bacon's question, "What did William Shakespeare do with Bacon's
      manuscripts?" Mr. Thompson ** seems to think that they may yet be brought
      to light. They "appear to have been so many times hypothetically burned,
      at Stratford, in the Globe theater, the London fire, by their owners (by
      purchase) at the play-house, to hinder rivals from using them," that Mr.
      Thompson argues that "it is probable they are still to the fore." Bacon's
      Will directs certain papers laid away in boxes, cabinets, and presses, to
      be collected, sealed up, and put away, "so as not to have them ready for
      present publication."

      He was "not ignorant that those kind of writings would, with less pains

      than those other which I <span class="pagenum">245</span><a name="link245"
      id="link245"></a>have in hand." They could bide their time, and, since
      William Shakespeare and his fellows do not dispose of them, the inference
      is that they were not allowed to retain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baconian theory, it is to be noticed, is quite indifferent as to
      whether William Shakespeare, on first turning up at London, found
      employment (as Mr. Grant White asserts) in his "cousin's law-office" or
      not: or whether, at any stage in his career, either in Stratford or
      London, he was an attorney's clerk, hard 'prentice at the trade of
      "noverint." (By which slur Mr. Fullom believes that Nash meant, not that
      Shakespeare was a "noverint," but that the young "nove-rints" of the time
      were "Shakespeare's;" that is to say, that they scribbled, out of hand,
      for the stage.) The Shakespearean problem is neither increased nor
      diminished by the proposition; even an attorney's clerk could not have
      written all the Shakespearean pages. Should it be necessary, however, to
      find a law-student in London who could have managed some of them, why not
      allow Francis Bacon his claim among the rest? He has, at least, this
      advantage of his rival; that, while it is the general impression
      now-a-days that William Shakespeare was not a law-student, as a matter of
      fact Francis Bacon <i>was</i>. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * And too good a law student, we think, to have written the
     law in the "Merchant of Venice." For, although Lord Bacon
     was apt to discover the public feeling, and quick to array
     himself on the right side (and spitting at Jews has always
     been accounted of Gentiles for righteousness), he must have
     seen that Shylock had a standing in court on the merits of
     his case.

     But Portia begins her extraordinary (according to common law
     at least) judgment by deciding for the Jew in that, not
     having paid the principal sum, Antonio must suffer in the
     foreclosure of the mortgage, as it were, upon his person.
     This is against the letter of any known law, which gives an
     equity of redemption to the debtor in all such cases. Her
     next decision is, that the Jew has his election between the
     principal sum and the penalty, and that, with his election,
     not the law itself can interfere. This, again, is not law;
     for the law abhors a penalty, and even in a foreclosure will
     not allow the debtor to be mulcted in more than the face of
     his debt, interest, and costs. But now, having decided,
     against all law, for the Jew, Portia begins deciding for the
     Christian, and the first point she makes is that, when
     Shylock takes his pound, he must not take a hair's weight
     more or less, nor yet one ounce of blood. This, again, is
     clearly not law, since it is an eternal principle of
     jurisprudence that, when the law grants any thing it also
     grants everything that is necessary to the conversion of
     that thing to possession (as, when it grants a farm, it
     likewise tacitly grants a right of way to that farm). So, if
     Shylock had had any title to his pound of flesh, he would
     certainly have had a title to draw as much blood as it was
     absolutely necessary to draw in cutting out that pound, and
     such portions of flesh over and above a pound as it would be
     absolutely necessary to cut out, providing the cutting out
     was done by a skillful operator and not a bungler. Astounded
     at this turn of the tide, Shylock deliberates, and finally
     cries, "Well, give me my principal and let me go!" Portia
     thereupon renders her fourth decision, which is the most
     astounding of all&mdash;namely, that, having once refused a
     tender of the money in open court, the Jew is not entitled
     to change his mind and take it! Since the days of Moses&mdash;
     certainly since the days of Littleton&mdash;a tender has never
     quite destroyed a debt, but only the interest and costs
     accruing upon it, after the tender! Such a glaring and high-
     handed sacrifice of common law and common sense to stage
     effect might have been conceived of by a manager anxious for
     the plaudits and pence of a crowded house, scarcely by a
     future lord chancellor of England.

      <span class="pagenum">246</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a>As to
      the bibliography of the Baconian theory, there are two volumes which will
      probably always remain its text-books, viz., Judge Holmes's book, of which
      the first edition appeared in 1862; and Mr. Smith's, printed in 1857,
      which made a convert of <span class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247"
      id="link247"></a>Lord Palmerston. Mr. Wilkes's exceedingly fresh and
      readable work, "Shakespeare from an American Point of View," and Mr.
      King's "Bacon versus Shakespeare; a Plea for the Defendant," as textbooks
      on the other side, could hardly be expected to produce much disorder in
      Messrs. Holmes and Smith's stern and compact columns of facts and
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilkes * decides off-hand against this Baconian theory at the start,
      and then goes on, like his predecessors, to construct a Shakespeare to
      suit himself. It is to his praise that he has endeavored to construct this
      Shakespeare out of the Shakespearean pages, rather than to have unreined
      his fancy. But he makes his own particular Shakespeare, nevertheless. The
      Wilkes Shakespeare is a Romanist. We consider this to William
      Shakespeare's praise, for to be a good Romanist is to be a good Christian,
      and to be one in a Protestant reign is to be a consistent Christian as
      well. But this is all the good Mr. Wilkes's Shakespeare is. Beyond that he
      is base-born, a man despised of his equals, and a flunkey and tidewaiter
      at the knees of an aristocracy to which he can not attain&mdash;an obscene
      jester, etc., etc.&mdash;and this author he calls Shakespeare. Such a one,
      whoever he is, is neither Bacon nor Raleigh, at all events. In 1880, Mr.
      Thompson, of Melbourne, Australia, published a volume, "Renascence Drama;
      or, History made Visible," ** devoted to an accumulation of fact and
      argument&mdash;rather than to a presentation of the case already made&mdash;in
      favor of the Baconian theory.

      Bacon's mind and art rather overgrasped than undergrasped the matter and

      and charming contribution to the pro-Baconian view.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his abounding zeal for "our Shakespeare," Mr. King * gives us much
      eulogy, very little argument, and remakes but one or two points, namely,
      that a large proportion of the Shakespearean characters are made to bear
      Warwickshire names, such as Ford, Page, Evans, Hugh, Oliver, Sly, Marion
      Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, Curtis, Burton Heath, Fluellen,
      Bar-dolph, and so on; and that certain expressions which have puzzled
      commentators, such as "make straight" (meaning "make haste"), "quoth"
      (meaning "went"), the use of the word "me" in place of "for me," "old" for
      "frequent," etc., are Warwickshire expressions, and current in no other
      parts of England. But, as anybody can see, the majority of these are far
      from being uncommon names, and are quite as prevalent in New York, for
      example, as they are or were in Warwickshire. And if, as has been
      suggested, Mr. Manager Shakespeare dressed up his friends' dialogues for
      his own stage, and tucked in the clowns and jades, this usage of Warwick
      names might well be accounted for.

      Four of these names are taken out of "The Merry Wives of Windsor," and
      three of them from the induction to the "Taming of the Shrew"&mdash;matter
      in the composition of which Shakespeare or <span class="pagenum">249</span><a
      name="link249" id="link249"></a>any other playwright might have had the
      largest hand, without entitling himself to any Olympus. And if, in the
      dressing up, Shakespeare inserted a clown or a sot here and there, to make
      sport, what would be more natural than that he should put into their
      mouths the <i>argot</i> he had grown up amid in his boyhood, and make the
      drunken turnkey in "Macbeth" to say, with hiccoughs, "If a man were porter
      of hell-gate, he should have <i>old</i> turning the key?" For, as Mr. King
      can see for himself, the cardinals and kings do not use these phrases;
      nor, we may add, are the surnames he particularizes ever bestowed on them,
      but only on the low-comedy characters of the plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, if William Shakespeare ever were forced "upon the country," as the
      lawyers say, as against my Lord Bacon, he would wish his case to the jury
      rather without Mr. King's "plea" than with it. As a "plea" on any side of
      an historical question, it is, to be sure, nothing, if not candid; but, as
      a personal appeal to posterity to, willy-nilly, believe that certain
      players and others in the age of Elizabeth knew not guile, it is touching
      and beautiful in the extreme. "Who shall, say Heminges and Condell lied?"

      published a paper, read before the Royal Society of Literature, by C. M.
      Ingleby, M. A., LL.D., a vice-president *** of the same. Dr. Ingleby is
      severe upon all anti-Shakespeareans, whose minds he likens to "Macadam's
      sieves," which "retain only those ingredients which are unsuited to the
      end in view" (whatever that may mean), and thinks that "the profession of
      the law has the inevitable effect of fostering the native tendency of such
      minds." Unlike the others, however, Dr. Ingleby does not confine himself
      to expressions of his interest in the anti-Shakespeareans "as examples of
      wrong-headedness," but attempts an examination of the historical
      testimony. In favor of the Shakespearean authorship, he names seven
      witnesses, viz., John Harrison, Francis Meres, Robert Greene, Henry
      Chettle, Heminges, Condell, and Ben Jonson. John Harrison was the printer
      (publisher) who published the "Venus and Adonis" in 1593, and the

      that Dr. Ingleby says, "It is to me quite incredible that Harrison would
      have done this unless Shakespeare had written the dedications, or at least
      had been a party to them." * As to Meres, anybody can see by reading him
      that he wrote as a <i>critic</i>, and not as an historian. ** To subpoena
      Greene as a witness to Shakespeare's genius, is at least a bold stroke;
      for, as has been seen, Greene is very emphatic to the effect that William
      Shakespeare was a mere "Johannes Factotum," or Jack-of-all-trades, who
      trained in stolen plumage, and the Shakespeareans (Dr. Ingleby alone
      excepted) have universally exerted themselves to break the force of this
      testimony by proving Greene a drunkard, jealous, etc. *** Greene <span

     ***  That Robert Greene was much more than a drunkard and a
     pretender, but that, to the contrary, he had many admirers
     who were not unaware of the effrontery of his debtor,
     Shakespeare, a search among the old literature of the day
     would reveal. In a quarto tract, dated 1594, "Greene's
     Funeralls, by R. B., Gent.," is a copy of verses, the last
     stanza of which runs:

     "Greene is the pleasing object of an eye

     Greene pleased the eye of all that looked upon him;

     Greene is the ground of every painter's dye,

     Greene gave the ground to all that wrote upon him:

     Nay, more; the men that so eclipsed his fame,

     Purloined his plumes, can they deny that same?"

     Hallam believes that the last two lines are directed
     principally at William Shakespeare. ("Literature of Europe,"
     Part II., ch. vi., p. 32, note.)

     A selection of his poems, edited by Lamb, is printed in
     Bohn's Standard Library. But by far the most careful account
     of Greene's career, as connected with "William Shakespeare,
     is to be found in "The School of Shakespeare," by Richard
     Simpson, London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1878, Vol. II., p. 339.
</pre>
    <p>
      He does not seem to have approved of William Shakespeare's borrowing his
      plumes; but the impression that he was a monster of debauchery and
      drunkenness is derived wholly from his own posthumous work, "The
      Confessions of Robert Greene," etc., London, 1592, which lays the black
      paint on so thickly that it should have put the critics on their guard.
      Greene was probably no worse than his kind. Henry Chettle edited Greene,
      and personally deprecated some of its hard sayings as to Shakespeare, on
      account of his (Shakespeare's) being a clever, civil sort of fellow, and
      of "his facetious grace in writing;" but more particularly, no doubt,
      because "divers of worship" had taken him up, and he (Chettle) did not
      wish to appear as approving slander of a reigning favorite. Heminges and
      Condell were men of straw, whose names are signed to the preface to the
      "first folio," who otherwise bear no testimony one way or the other, but
      whose book, as will be demonstrated further on, is an unwilling witness
      against its purported author. And Ben Jonson, who brings up the rear of
      this precious seven, has been already disposed of. That theory must be
      pretty soundly grounded in truth, against which there is nothing but
      rhetoric to hurl, and, in our opinion, it would be entirely safe&mdash;if
      not for the Baconians, for the anti-Shakespeareans, at least&mdash;to rest
      their case on the arguments for the other side. And we believe the more
      <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253" id="link253"></a>thoughtful
      among Shakespeareans are beginning to recognize it, and coming to
      comprehend that, if they are to keep their Shakespeare they must re-write
      their "Biographies;" spend less time in proving him to have been an
      epitome of the moral virtues&mdash;beyond the temptation of deer stealing,
      beer drinking, and skylarking, etc.&mdash;and devote more attention to his
      opportunities for acquiring the lore and technical knowledge his alleged
      pages so accurately handle. Especially has Mr. Halliwell Phillips, in his
      little book (in which he binds himself to cite no dates or authorities
      subsequent to 1616), * impressed us as endeavoring to meet this emergency.
      But we find that he has not met it. He has, indeed, developed many details
      of curious interest&mdash;as that John Shakespeare was, in April, 1552,
      fined twelve pence for throwing muck into the street in front of his
      house; and that he was several times a candidate for high bailiff of
      Stratford (or mayor, as the office was afterward called) before finally
      arriving at that dignity in 1568; that July 15, 1613, there was heard at
      Worcester Assizes a curious lawsuit, brought by Dr. John Hall,
      Shakespeare's son-in-law, against a neighbor for slandering his wife
      (Susannah Shakespeare), which suit appears to have been "fixed" in some
      way before coming to trial.

      F a matter so indifferent as the number of pebbles in Demosthenes' mouth
      when he practiced oratory on the beach, no effort of credulity can be
      predicated. But when a proposition is historical and capable of proving
      itself, it is, indeed, the skeptic who believes the most. It would be
      interesting, for example, to compile a catalogue of the reasons why A, B,
      and C, and their friends, doubt the real Shakespeare story, and cling to
      the manufactured tradition. A will tell us he believes it because somebody
      else (Bacon will do as well as anybody) wrote enough as it was, and was
      not the sort of man who would surrender any of the glory to which he was
      himself entitled, to another. B, because, when somebody else wrote poetry
      (for example, Bacon's "Paraphrase of the Psalms"), his style was quite
      another than the style of the dramas. C, because he is satisfied that
      William Shakespeare spent some terms at Stratford school, and was any
      thing but unkind to his wife. D, because the presumption is too old to be
      disturbed; as if we should always go on believing in William Tell and the
      man in the moon, because our ancestors believed in them! And so on,
      through the alphabet. It is so much easier, for instance, to believe that
      miracles should appear by the page, or that universal wisdom should spring
      fully <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>armed
      from the brain of a Warwickshire clown, than that Francis Bacon, or
      somebody else, should write anonymously, or in two hands, or use as a
      nomme de plume the name of a living man, instead of inventing one de novo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, say the New Theorists, if at about that time, a living nomme de plume
      should happened to be wanted, whose name was more cheaply purchasable than
      that of a young "Johannes Factotum," of the Blackfriars, who, by doing any
      thing and every thing that was wanted, and saving every honest penny he
      turned, actually became able to buy himself a coat-of-arms (the first
      luxury he ever appears to have allowed himself out of his increasing
      prosperity) * and a county seat?
    </p>
    <p>
      Four or five years before our historical William Shakespeare had bethought
      himself of wandering to London, one James Burbage, father of Richard, the
      actor, had built the Blackfriars Theater, a plain, rough building on the
      site of the present publishing office of the "Times."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  We happen on traces of the fact that William
     Shakespeare's particular weakness was his "noble descent"
     very often, in exploring the annals of these times, and that
     his fellow actors by no means spared his weakness. "It was
     then a current joke to identify Shakespeare with 'the
     Conqueror,' or 'Rufus,' as if his pretensions to descent
     from the Norman dukes were known" ("Ben Jonson's Quarrel
     with Shakspeare,"

     "North British Review," July, 1870). And certain lines in
     the "Poetaster" are supposed to be a fling at this weakness
     of Shakespeare, as the whole play is believed to be a hit at
     Marlow (id.). We shall see how this weakness was fostered by
     the new set into which circumstances forced Shakespeare,
     later on.
</pre>
    <p>
      Before its door (for the Blackfriars will answer as well as the Globe) we
      may, perhaps, <span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257"
      id="link257"></a>imagine a rustic lad&mdash;fresh from Stratford, and
      footsore from his long tramp, attracted by the crowd and the lights,
      standing idle and agape. Possibly, then, riding up, some gallant threw
      young William his horse's bridle, and William Shakespeare had found
      employment in London. By attention to business, William, in time, may
      have, as Rowe thinks, come to control the horse-holding business, and take
      his predecessors into his pay; until they became known as "Shakespeare's
      boys," and the young speculator's name penetrated to the inside of the
      theater. In course of time he becomes a "<i>servitour</i>" (what we now
      call a "super," i. e., supernumerary) inside, and ultimately (according to
      Rowe, an actor himself, and the nearest in point of time to William
      Shakespeare to write his biography) "the reader" * of the establishment;
      and naturally, therefore, stage editor of whatever is offered. He has no
      royal road to learning at his command, nor does he want one. The "knack at
      speech-making," which had delighted the rustic youth of Stratford,
      mellowed by the new experiences which surround him, is all he needs. Not
      only the plays of Greene and others, which he now remodeled (and improved,
      no doubt), but essays of his own, became popular. The audience (we shall
      see more of them further on) called for "Shakespeare's plays," and his
      name came to possess a market value.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  In this capacity he read and accepted Ben Jonson's "Every
     Man in his Humour," which was the beginning of the intimacy
     which ended with their lives.
</pre>
    <p>
      The dramas we now call "Shakespearean" surely did appear in his lifetime,
      and under his name. Were <span class="pagenum">258</span><a name="link258"
      id="link258"></a>they ever performed at his theater? Let us glance at the
      probabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "theaters" of this day are barely more than inclosures, with a raised
      platform for the performers, and straw for the audience to stand or go to
      sleep in, as they prefer. Votton, in a letter to Bacon, * says that the
      fire that destroyed the Globe theater burned up nothing but "a little wood
      and straw and a few forsaken cloaks." Sir Philip Sidney, writing in 1583,
      ridicules the poverty of the scenic effects and properties of the day in
      an often-quoted passage: "You shall have Asia of the one side and Afrieke
      of the other, and so many other under kingdomes that the plaier, when hee
      comes in, must ever begin with telling where hee is, or else the tale will
      not be conceived. Now, you shall have three ladies walk to gather flowers,
      and then you must believe the stage to be a garden: by-and-by we have news
      of a shipwreck in the same place; and we are to blame if we accept it not
      for a rock. Upon the back of that comes a hideous monster, with fire and
      smoke, and the miserable beholders are bound to take it for a cave, while,
      in the mean time, two armies fly in, represented with four swords and
      bucklers, and then what hard heart will not receive it for a pitched
      field!" **

    <p>
      And M. Taine has drawn a life-like picture of the audience which applauded
      this performance: "The poor could enter as well as the rich; there were
      sixpenny, twopenny, even penny seats.... If it rained, and it often rained
      in London, the people in <span class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259"
      id="link259"></a>the pit, botchers, mercers, bakers, sailors, apprentices,
      receive the streaming rain on their heads... they did not trouble
      themselves about it. While waiting for the pieces they... drink beer,
      crack nuts, eat fruit, howl, and now and then resort to their lists: they
      have been known to fall upon the actors, and turn the theater upside down.
      At other times they were dissatisfied and went to the tavern to give the
      poet a hiding or toss him in a blanket,... When the beer took effect there
      was a great upturned barrel in the pit, a receptacle for general use. The
      smell arises, and then comes the cry, 'Burn the juniper!' They burn some
      in a plate in the stage, and the heavy smoke fills the air. Certainly the
      folk there assembled could scarcely get disgusted at any thing, and can
      not have had sensitive noses. In the time of Rabelais there was not much
      cleanliness to speak of. Remember that they were hardly out of the middle
      age, and that, in the middle age, man lived on a dunghill." Mr. White
      assures us further, that pickpockets were apt to be plentiful among this
      audience, and when discovered, were borne upon the stage, pilloried in
      full view, * and there left, the play going on meanwhile around them; and,
      moreover, that the best seats sold were on the stage itself; where any of
      the audience, who could pay the price, could sit, recline, walk, or
      converse with the actors engaged in the performance," while pages brought
      them rushes to stretch upon, and&mdash;&mdash;

      * "Kempe, the actor, in his 'Nine Days' Wonder,' a. d. 1600, compares a
      man to 'such an one as we tye to a poast on our stage for all the people
      to wonder at when they are taken pilfering.'" ("Shakespeare," by Richard
      Grant White, Vol. I., p. 183.) <span class="pagenum">260</span><a

      themselves. * "Practicable" scenery of any sort, even the rudest, was
      utterly unknown, ** and it is thought that the actors relied on barely
      more than the written action of the piece for their guidance. In the plays
      of this period we come continually on such stage directions as "Here they
      two talke and rayle what they list;" "All speak "Here they all talke,"
      etc., *** which proves that much of the dialogue was trusted to the
      inspiration of the moment&mdash;to which inspiration the gallants and
      pickpockets may not unnaturally have contributed.

     *  Ibid.

     **  Whenever we come on a stage direction, therefore, which
     supposes "practicable" scenery in a play, we may assert with
     confidence, that the same was written in or after 1662, up
     to which date there was no such thing as practicable
     machinery. In the original edition of "The Tempest," for
     instance, there is no intimation, by way of stage direction,
     that the first scene occurs on shipboard. In the first
     edition of "As You Like It" there is no mention of a forest
     in the stage direction. Nor in the early quartos of "Romeo
     and Juliet" is there any intimation that Juliet makes love
     in a balcony. "What child is there, that, coming to a play,
     and seeing Thebes written in great letters upon an old door,
     doth believe that it is Thebes?" says Sidney, in his
     "Defence of Poesie."&mdash;(R. G. White's "Shakespeare's
     Scholar," p. 489, note.) Trap-doors, however, were probably
     in very early use; at least, we find in a comedy by
     Middleton and Dekkar a character called "Trap-door." There
     seems, also, to have been pillars that turned about, and a
     writer in the times of James I. mentions that "the stage
     varied three times in one tragedy."

     ***  These stage directions are taken from Greene's "Tu
     Quoque," a. d. 1614, two years before Shakespeare died, and
     long after, according to the commentators, he had ceased
     writing for the stage.

      The principal burden of entertaining the audience rested with the clown,
      who, unembarrassed by any <span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261"
      id="link261"></a>reference to the subject-matter of the play, popped in
      and out at will, cracked his jokes, danced and sung and made himself
      familiar with the outsiders upon the stage. Before an audience satisfied
      with this rudimentary setting, upon a stage crowded with smirking gallants
      and flirting maids of honor, we are assured that Hamlet and Wolsey
      delivered their soliloquies, Anthony his impassioned oratory, and Isabella
      her pious strains; while the clowns and pot-wrestlers discoursed among
      themselves of Athens and Troy, and Hecuba and Althea, of Galen and
      Paracelus, of "writs of detainer," and "fine and recovery," and
      "pr√¶munire," and of the secrets of the pharmacopoeia! "At this public
      theater," says Mr. Smith, "to which every one could obtain access, and the
      lowest of the people ordinarily resorted... we are called upon to believe
      that the wonderful works which we so greatly admire and feel we can only
      appreciate by careful private study&mdash;that not only Englishmen like
      Coleridge confess, in forty years of admiring study of Greek, Latin,
      English, Italian, Spanish, and German philosophers, literature, and
      manners, to have found bursting upon him with increased power, wisdom, and
      beauty in every step," * but foreigners like Schlegel, Jean Paul, and
      Gervinus, "have fallen down before in all but heathen adoration"&mdash;were
      performed. In 1880, when we force a common-school education at state
      expense upon the people, the Shakespearean plays are disastrous to
      managers.

      London, these grave, intellectual, and stately dialogues are taking by
      storm the rabble of the Bankside, and entrancing the tradesmen and
      burghers of the days when to read was quite as rare an accomplishment as
      serpent-charming is today&mdash;when, if sovereigns wrote their own names,
      it was all they could do&mdash;and when the government could not afford to
      hang a man who could actually write his name. * "And yet," to quote Mr.
      Smith again, "it was from the profit arising from this wretched place of
      amusement that Shakespeare realized the far from inconsiderable fortune
      with which in a few years he retired to Stratford-upon-Avon." If not
      actual intellectual giants, the rabble of that day must have been the
      superiors in literary perception of some very eminent gentlemen who were
      to come after them, like, for example, Fuller, Evelyn, Pepys, Dryden,
      Dennis, Kymer, Hume, Pope, Addison, Steele, and Jonson, whose comments on
      our immortal drama we have set forth in the First Part of this work. **
      Only we happen to know they were not.

      As an alternative to believing that these pearls, over which this
      nineteenth century gloats, were cast before the swine of the sixteenth;
      the theory we are now considering offers, as less violent an attack upon
      common sense, the supposition that what we now possess under the name of
      "Shakespeare's plays" were <i>not</i> produced upon the stage of any
      play-house in those days, but were <i>printed</i> instead, the name of
      William Shakespeare having been attached to them as surety for a certain
      circulation. The well-attested fact that William Shakespeare was a
      play-writer is not ignored by this supposition; for the new theorists
      believe that, although no fragment of the Shakespeare work now survives,
      its character can be readily determined. From what knowledge we possess of
      the tone and quality of the audiences of those days, it is not difficult
      to imagine the rudeness and crudity of the plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the formative days of audiences, and, therefore, the formative
      days of plays. Sir Henry Wotton, in a letter from which we have just
      quoted, written to Lord Bacon in 1631, refers to one of these plays called
      "The Hog hath lost its Pearl." Says this letter: "Now it is strange to
      hear how sharp-witted the city is; for they will needs have Sir Thomas
      Swinnerton, the Lord Mayor, be meant by the hog, and the late Lord
      Treasurer by the pearl." There is no disputing the fact, at least, that
      the plays we call "Shakespeare's" are cast in a mold by themselves, and
      have no contemporary exemplar. The student of these days knows the fact
      that Dekker, Webster, Massinger, Jonson, or any other who wrote in periods
      that are counted "literature," made no fortunes at their work. That such
      as this one alluded to by Wotton&mdash;and one example will suffice&mdash;were
      what the town ran to see in those days, mere local sketches&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">264</span><a name="link264" id="link264"></a>lampoons on
      yesterday's events; coarse parables, the allusions in which could be met
      and enjoyed by the actors themselves (were to the popular taste, that is
      to say), is much easier to conceive than that the "Hamlet" and the "Lear"
      were to the popular taste. One Dr. Ileywood (who, it is to be noted, is
      sometimes called the "prose Shakespeare") is understood to have produced
      some two hundred and twenty of this sort of sketches alone; and, possibly,
      this was the sort of "early essays at dramatic poetry" which Aubrey speaks
      of: this "the facetious grace in writing that approves his wit" which
      Chettle assigns to William Shakespeare&mdash;mere sketches in silhouette
      of the town's doings, such as would appeal, as this sort still do in
      cities, to a popular and local audience. There is some curious testimony
      on the subject, which looks to that effect.

      It is probable that, in the production of these plays, 'William
      Shakespeare was not always scrupulous to compose "without blotting out a
      line" himself. That he was a reckless borrower, and scissored
      unconscionably from Robert Greene and others (so much so that <span
      class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>Greene wrote
      a whole book in protest), we have Greene's book itself to testify. From
      its almost unintelligible pages we can glean some idea of the turgid
      English of the day. It was, of course, in the composition of this popular
      English that Shakespeare, by surpassing Greene, awakened the latter's
      jealousy. Otherwise, there would have been no superiority in Shakespeare
      over Greene which Greene could have perceived: or, at least, no cutting
      into Greene's profits wherein Greene could have found cause for jealousy.
      For, if Greene had continued to earn money indifferently to whether
      Shakespeare carried on his trade or not, he would not have been "jealous."
      But so fluent and clever a fellow as this William Shakespeare of
      Stratford, who could hold, when a mere boy, his rustic audience with a
      speech over a calf-sticking, was a dangerous rival among the hackney
      stock-playwrights of London, and would easily have made himself invaluable
      to his management by dashing off scores of such local sketches as "The Hog
      hath lost his Pearl," suggested by the current events of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even if "Hamlet," "Othello," "King Lear," "Macbeth," and "Julius
      C√¶sar" could have been produced by machinery, and engrossed currente
      calamo, (so that the author's first draft should be the acting copy for
      the players), they could have hardly been composed, nowadays, without a
      library. And even had William Shakespeare possessed an encyclopaedia (such
      as were first invented two hundred years or so after his funeral) he would
      not have found it inclusive of all the reference he needed for those five
      plays alone. They can not be studied as they are capable of being <span
      class="pagenum">267</span><a name="link267" id="link267"></a>studied&mdash;as
      they were found capable of being studied by Coleridge and Gervinus&mdash;without
      a library. And yet are we to be asked to believe they were composed
      without one?&mdash;in the days when such a thing as a dictionary even was
      unknown! Who ever heard of William Shakespeare in his library, pulling
      down volumes, dipping into folios, peering into manuscripts, his brain in
      throe and his pen in labor, weaving the warp and woof of his poetry and
      his philosophy, at the expense of Greece and Rome and Egypt; pillaging
      alike from tomes of Norseman lore and Southern romance&mdash;for the
      pastime of the rabble that sang bawdy songs and swallowed beer amid the
      straw of his pit, and burned juniper and tossed his journey-actors in
      blankets?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always interesting to read of the habitudes of authors&mdash;of
      paper-saving Pope scribbling his "Iliad" on the backs of old
      correspondence, of Spenser by his fireside in his library at Kilcolman
      Castle, of Scott among his dogs, of Gibbon biting at the peaches that hung
      on the trees in his garden at Lausanne, of Schiller declaiming by mountain
      brook-sides and in forest paths, of Goldsmith in his garrets and his
      jails. Even of Chaucer, dead and buried before Shakespeare saw the light,
      we read of his studies at Cambridge, his call to the bar, and his chambers
      in the Middle Temple. But of William Shakespeare&mdash;after ransacking
      tradition, gossip, and the record&mdash;save and except the statement of
      Ben Jonson how he had heard the actor's anecdote about his never blotting
      his lines&mdash;not a word, not a breath, can be found to connect him
      with, or surprise him in any agency or employment as to the composition of
      the plays we <span class="pagenum">268</span><a name="link268" id="link268"></a>insist
      upon calling his&mdash;much less to the possession of a single book! Did
      William Shakespeare own a library? Had we found this massive draught upon
      antiquity in the remains of an immortal Milton or a mortal Tupper, or in
      all the range of letters between, we should not have failed to presume a
      library. Why should we believe that William Shakespeare needed none?&mdash;that,
      as his pen ran, he never paused to lift volume from the shelf to refresh
      or verify his marvelously retentive recollection? There was no Astor or
      Mercantile Library around the corner from the Globe or the Blackfriars, in
      those days. And, as for his own possessions, he leaves in his Will no hint
      of book or library, much less of the literature the booksellers had taken
      the liberty of christening with his name! Where is the scholar who glories
      not in his scholarship? By universal testimony, the highest pleasure which
      an author draws from his own completed work, the pride of the poet in his
      own poem, is their chiefest payment. The simple fact&mdash;which stands
      out so prominently in the life of this man that nobody can gainsay it&mdash;that
      William Shakespeare took neither pride nor pleasure in any of the works
      which passed current with the rest of the world as his, might well make
      the most casual student of those days suspicious of a claim that, among
      his other accomplishments, William Shakespeare was an author at all.

      Just here we are referred to a passage in Fuller's "Worthies:"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many were the wit combats," says Fuller, "between Shakespeare and Ben
      Jonson;... I beheld them," etc. But Fuller was only eight years old when
      Shakespeare died, and possibly spoke from hearsay, as it is hardly
      probable that an infant of such <span class="pagenum">269</span><a
      name="link269" id="link269"></a>tender years was permitted to spend his
      nights in "The Mermaid." Besides, these "wit combats" at "The Mermaid" are
      now said to be "<i>wet</i> combats," i. e. drinking-bouts, by a
      long-adopted misprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, unless we are misled by a typographical error in the
      edition before us, * what Fuller <span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>did actually say was, not "wit combats,"
      but "wet combats." But even if they were "wit combats," and not friendly
      contests at ale-guzzling, like the early tournament at "Piping Pebworth"
      and "Drunken Bidford," the "wit" could not have been colossal, if we may
      judge from one example preserved in the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford,
      as stated by Capell. "Ben" (Jonson) and "Bill"' (Shakespeare) propose a
      joint epitaph.

     "William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-on-Avon, in this
     county, in whom three eminent Poets may seem in some sort to
     be compounded. 1. Martial in the warlike sound of his
     surname (whence some may conjecture him of a military
     extraction), Hasli-vibrans or Shake-speare. 2. Ovid, the
     most naturall and witty of Poets; and hence it was that
     Queen Elizabeth, coming into a grammar school, made this
     extemporary verse&mdash;

     "Persius a Crab-Staffe, Bawdy Martial, Ovid a fine Wag.

     "3. Plautus who was an exact Commedian, yet never any
     Scholar, as one Shakespeare (if alive) would confess
     himself. Adde to all these that, though his genius generally
     was jocular, and inclining him to festivity, yet he could
     (when so disposed) be solemn and serious, as appears by his
     Tragedies; so that Heraclitus himself (I mean if secret and
     unseen) might afford to smile at his Comedies, they were so
     merry; and Democritus scarce forbear to sigh at his
     tragedies, they were so mournfull.

     "He was an eminent instance of the truth of that Rule, Poeta
     non fit sed nascitur, 'One is not made but born a poet.'
     Indeed, his learning was very little, so that as Cornish
     diamonds are not polished by any lapidary, but are pointed
     and smoothed even as they are taken out of the earth, so
     nature itself was all the Art which was used upon him. Many
     were the wet-combates betwixt him and Ben Jonson; which two
     I beheld like a Spanish great gallion and an English man of
     war, lesser in bulk but lighter in sailing, could turn with
     all tides, tack about and take advantage of all winds, by
     the quickness of his wit and invention. He died Anno
     Domini... and was buried at Stratford-upon-Avon, the town of
     his nativity."

      This being the sort of literature which William Shakespeare's pen turned
      out during his residence in London, he could manage very well without a
      library. And it was the most natural thing in the world that, after
      retiring to the shade of Stratford, it should have produced, on occasion,
      the famous epitaphs on his friends Elias James and "Thinbeard." At all
      events, this is a simpler explanation than the "deterioration of power,"

      And, moreover, it is a satisfactory explanation of what can not be
      explained in any other way (and which no Shakespearean has ever yet
      attempted to explain at all), of the fact that William Shakespeare, making
      his last Will and Testament at Stratford, in 1515, utterly ignored the
      existence of any literary property among his assets, or of his having used
      his pen, at any period, in accumulating the competency of which he died
      possessed. Had William Shakespeare been the courtly favorite of two
      sovereigns (which Mr. Hallam doubts * ), it is curious that he never was
      selected to write a Masque. Masques were the standard holiday diversions
      of the nobles of the day, to which royalty was so devoted that it is said
      the famous Inigo Jones was maintained for some years in the employment of
      devising the trappings for them alone (though, of course, it is no
      evidence, either way, as to the matter we have in hand). But if William
      Shakespeare was the shrewd and prosperous tradesman that we have record of
      (and, that he came to London poor and left it rich, everybody knows), was
      he not shrewd enough, as well, to see that his audiences did not require
      philosophical essays and historical treatises; that he need not waste his
      midnight oil to verify the customs of the early Cyprians, or pause to
      explore for them the secrets of nature? We may assert him to be a "great
      moral teacher" to-day; but, had he been a "great moral teacher" then, he
      would have set his stage to empty houses. He could have earned the same
      money with much less trouble to <span class="pagenum">272</span><a

      The gallants would have resorted to his stage daily (as they would have
      gone to the baths if they had been in old Home); and the ha'penny seats
      have enjoyed themselves quite as much had he given them the school of "The
      Hog hath lost his Pearl," or "The Devil is an Ass," or the tumbles of a
      clown. Why should this thrifty manager have ransacked Greek and Latin and
      Italian letters, the romance of Italy and the Sagas of the Horth (or,
      according to Dr. Farmer, rummaged the cloisters of all England, to get
      these at second hand)? Had these all been collected in a public library,
      would he have had leisure to sit down and pull them over for this precious
      audience of his, these gallants and groundlings&mdash;when his money was
      quite as safe if he merely reached out and took the nearest spectacle at
      hand (as he took his "Taming of the Shrew," "Winter's Tale," "sea-coast of
      Bohemia," and all&mdash;from Robert Greene)? But, if we may be allowed to
      conceive that it was the <i>action</i> (that is to say, the "business") of
      the Shakespearean plays that delighted this Shakespearean audience (that
      filled the cockpit, galleries, and boxes, while poor Ben Jonson's,
      according to Digges, would hardly bring money enough to pay for a sea-coal
      fire), and that certain greater than the manager used this action
      thereafter as a dress for the mighty transcripts caused to be printed
      under voucher of the popular manager's name&mdash;if we may be allowed to
      conceive this&mdash;however exceptional, it is at least an accounting for
      the Shakespearean plays as we possess them to-day, without doing violence
      to human experience and the laws of nature.

      Southampton, Raleigh, Essex, Rutland, and Montgomery are young noblemen of
      wealth and leisure, <span class="pagenum">273</span><a name="link273"
      id="link273"></a>who "pass away the time merely in going to plays every
      day." * We have seen that the best seats were on the stage, and these, of
      course, the young noblemen occupied. There were no actresses in those days&mdash;the
      female parts were taken by boys&mdash;but titled ladies and maids of honor
      were admitted to seats on the stage as well as the gallants, and a thrifty
      stage manager might easily make himself useful to both. If my Lord
      Southampton was bosom friend to William Shakespeare (as rumor has it),
      their intimacy arose probably through some such service. A noble youth of
      nineteen, of proverbial gallantry and sufficient wealth (though, it must
      be remembered, as among the fortunes of his day, a comparatively poor man;
      not able to give away $25,000 at a time, for instance), was not at so
      great a loss for a friend and alter ego in London in 1593 (the date at
      which the "Venus and Adonis" is dedicated to him) as to be forced to
      forget the social gulf that separated him from an economical commoner
      (lately a butcher in the provinces), however popular a stage manager,
      except for cause; and it takes considerable credulity to believe that he
      did forget it (if he did), through being dazzled by the transcendent
      literary abilities of the economical commoner aforesaid.

     *  "My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland come not to the
     court, the one but very seldom; they pass away the time
     merely in going to plays every day."&mdash;(Letter from Rowland
     White to Sir Robert Sidney, dated October 11, 1599, quoted
     by Kenny, "Life and Genius of Shakespeare." London:
     Longmans, 1864. p. 34, note.) But it may be noted that
     Southampton and Raleigh were opposed to each other in
     politics.
</pre>
    <p>
      For Southampton lived and died without ever being suspected of a devotion
      to literature or literary pur<span class="pagenum">274</span><a
      name="link274" id="link274"></a>suits; and, besides, the economical
      commoner had not then written (if he ever did write) the "Hamlet" and
      "Lear," and those other evidences of the transcendent literary ability
      which could seduce a peer outside his caste. That the gallants and stage
      managers of the day understood each other, just as they perhaps do today,
      there is reason to believe. Dekker, in his "Gull's Horn-Book," says that,
      "after the play was over, poets adjourned to supper with knights, where
      they in private unfolded the secret parts of their dramas to them." By
      "poets" in this extract is meant, as appears from the context, the writers
      of dramas for the stage; such as, perhaps, William Shakespeare was. But
      whether these suppers after the play were devoted to intellectual and
      philosophical criticism is a question for each one's experience to aid him
      in answering. Whether William Shakespeare was admitted to this noble
      companionship, or was only emulous of the honor, we have no means of
      conjecture, as either might account for the fact that with his first
      savings he purchased a grant of arms for his father, thus obtaining not
      only an escutcheon, but one whole generation of ancestry; a transaction
      which involved, says Dr. Farmer, the falsehood aud venality of the father,
      the son and two kings at arms, and did not escape protest; * for if ever a
      coat was "cut from whole cloth," we may be sure that this coat-of-arms was
      the one.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A complaint must have been made from some quarter that
     this application had no sufficient foundation, for we have,
     in the Herald's college, a manuscript which purports to be
     "the answer of Garter and Clarencieux, kings of arms, to a
     libellous scrowl against certain arms supposed to be
     wrongfully given in which the writers state, under the head
     "Shakespeare," that "the person to whom it was granted had
     borne magistracy, and was justice of peace, at Stratford-
     upon-Avon; he married the daughter and heir of Arden, and
     was able to maintain that estate." The whole of this
     transaction is involved in considerable, and, perhaps, to a
     great extent, intentional obscurity; and it still seems
     doubtful whether any grant was actually made in the year
     1596. In the year 1599, the application must have been
     renewed in a somewhat altered form. Under that date, there
     exists a draft of another grant, by which John Shakespeare
     was further to be allowed to impale the ancient arms of
     Arden. In this document a statement was originally inserted
     to the effect that "John Shakespeare showed and produced his
     ancient coat-of-arms, heretofore assigned to him whilst he
     was her Majesty's officer and bailiff of that town." But the
     words "showed and produced" were afterward erased, and in
     this unsatisfactory manner the matter appears to have
     terminated.

     It is manifest that the entries we have quoted contain a
     number of exaggerations, one even of positive misstatements.
     The "parents and antecessors" of John Shakespeare were not
     advanced and rewarded by Henry VII.; but the maternal
     ancestors, or, more probably, some more distant relatives of
     William Shakespeare, appear to have received some favors and
     distinctions from that sovereign. The pattern of arms given,
     as it is stated, under the hand of Clareneieux (Cooke, who
     was then dead), is not found in his records, and we can
     place no faith in his allegation. John Shakespeare had been
     a justice of the peace, merely ex officio, and not by
     commission, as is here insinuated; in all probability he did
     not possess "lands and tenements of the value of five
     hundred pounds;" and Robert Arden, of Wilmecote, was not a
     "gentleman of worship."&mdash;(Kenny, "Life and Genius of
     Shakespeare," p. 38. London: Longmans, 1854.)

      wrote Hamlet's soliloquy and Antony's oration might well have written the
      "Venus and Adonis" and the "Lucrece," and was quite equal to the bold
      stroke of describing the former (the most splendidly sensuous poem in any
      language&mdash;a poem that <span class="pagenum">276</span><a
      name="link276" id="link276"></a>breathes in every line the blase and
      salacious exquisite), as the first heir of the invention of a busy London
      manager and whilom rustic Lothario among 'Warwickshire milkmaids. The
      question as to the authorship of the one hundred and fifty-four "Sonnets,"
      which appeared (with the exception of two, printed in 1598, in a
      collection of verses called for some un-suggested reason "The Passionate
      Pilgrim") in 1609, need not enter into any anti-Shakespearean theory at
      all. Except that one Francis Meres, writing in 1598&mdash;eleven years
      before&mdash;had reported William Shakespeare to have circulated certain
      "sugared sonnets among his private friends;" * and that the one hundred
      and thirty-sixth of the series says the author's name is "Will" (the
      common nickname of a poet of those days), ** there is nothing to connect
      them with William Shakespeare except his name on the title-page&mdash;in
      the days when we have seen that printers put whatever name they pleased or
      thought most vendable, upon a title-page. (When the aforesaid "Passionate
      Pilgrim" was printed in 1598&mdash;also as by William Shakespeare&mdash;Dr.
      Ileywood recognized two of his own compositions incorporated in it, and
      promptly claimed them. "No evidence," says Mr. Grant White, *** in
      commenting on this performance, "of any public denial on Shakespeare's
      part is known to exist. It was not until the publication of the third
      edition of the poem, in 1612, that William Shakespeare's name was
      removed.")

      But what involves the authorship of the sonnets in still <span
      class="pagenum">277</span><a name="link277" id="link277"></a>deeper
      obscurity is the fact that their publisher, Thomas Thorpe, himself
      dedicates them to a friend of his own. He addresses his friend as "Mr. W.
      H.," and signs the dedication with his own initials "T. T." Perhaps it was
      just as the name "Shakespeare" was fastened to the title-page of "The
      Passionate Pilgrim," and the plays to which, as we shall notice the
      Shakespeareans declare it never belonged, that Mr. Thomas Thorpe calls his
      book "Shakespeare's Sonnets, never before imprinted," and makes in the
      pages of the Stationers' Company the entry: "20 May, 1609. Tho. Thorpe. A
      book called Shake-speare's Sonnets." They appear conjointly with a long
      poem entitled "A Lover's Complaint," and two of them (as we have said) had
      already been printed in "The Passionate Pilgrim," published by Jaggard in
      1598. This unhappy dedication has been so twisted by the commentators to
      serve their turns, that the only safety is to print it as it stood in this
      first edition:

      were ventures in those days. The printer might get His money back and he
      might not. But, until he did, he was an adventurer. So Mr. Thorpe, in
      setting forth on his adventure, wishes well to his publication and to some
      unknown patron whom he desires&mdash;as was the custom&mdash;to compliment
      with wishes of long life and happiness. At least this would seem to be the
      reading on the face of it. To be sure, there is a slight uncertainty as to
      whether "Mr. W. H." is dedicator or dedicatee. But the moment the name of
      Shakespeare appears this little trouble becomes insignificant&mdash;and,
      as usual, difficulties begin to crowd and multiply.

      Mr. Armitage Brown, who flourished in or about the year 1838, and appears
      to have been the first gentleman who ever took the trouble to read them,
      has demonstrated * that these sonnets are actually six poems of different
      lengths **&mdash;each poem having a consistent theme and argument (and he
      made this discovery by the simple process of reading them).

    <p>
      Can any body believe that, if these six poems had been the work of the
      mighty Shakespeare of the Shakespear<span class="pagenum">279</span><a
      name="link279" id="link279"></a>eans, they would have waited until 1838
      without a reader? And, most wonderful of all, that this mighty poet in his
      own lifetime would allow six of his poems to be torn up into isolated
      stanzas by a printer, stirred together and run into type hap-hazard, and
      sold as his "Sonnets?" The Shakespeareans tell us sometimes of their
      William's utter indifference to fame, but they have never claimed for him
      an imperturbability quite so stolid as this. And while we could not well
      imagine Mr. Tennyson regarding with complaisance a publisher who would
      print his "Maud," "Locksley Hall," "Lady Clara," etc., each verse standing
      by itself, and calling the whole "Mr. Tennyson's Sonnets," so we fancy
      even Mr. Shakespeare of the Globe, had he been their author, would have
      thought the printers were going a little too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, all the same, the Shakespeareans, Mr. Armitage Brown among the rest,
      are determined that these sonnets shall be Shakespeare's and nobody
      else's, and proceed to tell us who "Mr. W. H." (to whom Mr. Thorpe, at
      William Shakespeare's request&mdash;as if the the man who wrote the
      sonnets could not write a dedication of them&mdash;dedicated them) is.
      Certain of them believe the letters "W. H." to be a transposition of "H.
      W.," in which case they might stand for "Henry Wriothesley," Earl of
      Southampton. Mr. Boaden and two Mr. Browns * read them, as they stand, to
      mean William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke (in either case accounting for
      William Shakespeare addressing in earl as "Mr."&mdash;which may mean
      "Mister" or "Mas<span class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280"

      A learned Frenchman, M. Chasles, has conjectured that Thomas Thorpe wrote
      the first half of the dedication, including the "Mr. W. H.," and William
      Shakespeare the second half (including, perhaps, though M. Chasles does
      not say so, the "T. T.") One equally learned German (Herr Bernsdorff)
      suggests that "W. H." means "William Himself," and that the great
      Shakespeare meant to dedicate these poems to his own personality (as
      George Wither, in 1611, dedicated his satirical poems, "G. W. wisheth
      himself all happiness;") and another supposes Shakespeare to have been in
      love with a negress, "black but comely," like the lady of the Canticles.
      Yet another, that this dark lady typified "Dramatic art," the Roman
      Catholic church, etc., etc. Mr. Dowden will have it that Shakespeare and
      Spenser, and Mento that Shakespeare and Chapman were rivals for the lady's
      favor. And there have been other and even more puerile speculations put
      gravely forth by these same learned and venerable commentators: such as,
      since the word "Hewes" (in the line, "A man in Hewes all Hewes in his
      controlling"), is spelled with a capital letter, that, therefore, "AY. H."
      is William Hewes (whoever he might have been). Wadsworth believes that
      these sonnets were the repository of the real emotions of William
      Shakespeare, as a relief to long simulation of other people's emotions in
      his dramas; while Mr. William Thompson * believes them to be The Sonnett,
      which Bacon mentions writ<span class="pagenum">281</span><a name="link281"
      id="link281"></a>ing in or about 1598, saying: "It happened a little
      before that time that her Majesty had a purpose to dine at Twickenham
      Park, at which time I had (though I profess not to be a poet) prepared a
      <i>sonnet</i>, directly tending and alluding to draw on her Majesty's
      reconcilement to my lord, which I remember I also showed to a great
      person," etc.

</pre>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Thompson believes that this "great person" was William Herbert,
      who read them among the friends of the putative author&mdash;was, in
      short, the "W. H." Mr. Thompson points out that, if these sonnets are not
      Bacon's <i>Sonnet</i>, the latter has never been found, among Bacon's
      papers or elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these are the sonnets distributed by William Shakespeare among his
      private friends&mdash;of which Meres seems to have known in 1598&mdash;there
      would be this historical difficulty in connecting them with Lord Herbert,
      afterwards Earl of Pembroke, viz: In the Sydney Papers * is preserved a
      letter from Rowland White to Sir Robert Sydney, in which the writer says:
      "My Lord Herbert hath, with much ado, brought his father to consent that
      he may live at London, but not before the next spring." This letter is
      dated April 19,1597. "The next spring" would be 1598, the very year in
      which Meres speaks of these sonnets as in existence among William
      Shakespeare's friends. Of course, they might have been afterwards
      collected and dedicated by their author.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Vol. II., p. 43.
</pre>
    <p>
      But at the time they were so collected, Lord Herbert was Earl Pembroke,
      and was surely not <i>then</i>, if he had ever been (which he had <span
      class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a>not), plain
      "Mr. H." In other words, if the sonnets were William Shakespeare's, he
      must either have dedicated them to a stranger&mdash;a boy at Oxford&mdash;or
      have waited until that hoy had become of age and an earl, and then
      dedicated them to him in either case by a title not his own. In the
      absence of explanation., nowadays, we would be obliged to regard such a
      dedication an insult rather than a compliment. And men were at least no
      less punctilious about titles in the age of Elizabeth than they are
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting, in this connection, to note that in 1595, and while
      young Lord Herbert was at Oxford, a play, "Edward III.," was entered in
      the register of the Stationers' Company. In both this play and in Sonnett

    <p>
      Were there <i>any</i> means of ascertaining in which the line is original
      and in which quotation, it might be of aid in solving this question of
      authorship. But, unhappily, none are at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hiel believes that "W. H." means "William Hathaway," Shakespeare's
      brother-in-law, and that "onlie begetter" of these sonnets means "only
      collector;" (going into considerable philology to make good his
      assertion), and that Hathaway collected his broth-er-in-law's manuscripts
      and carried them to Thorpe. Mr. Massey has, for his part, constructed a
      tremendous romance out of the sonnets, * in which "W. H." means <span

      But all these commentators alike agree to ignore the fact that William
      Shakespeare did not dedicate the sonnets to any body, or, so far as we
      know, procure Thomas Thorpe to do so for him. A poem, "The Phoenix and the
      Turtle," is sometimes bound up with these, described as "Verses among the
      Additional Poems to Love's Martyr; or, Rosalin's Complaint," printed in
      1601, but nobody knows by what authority, except that publishers have got
      into the habit of doing so.

      Then, again, anonymous authorship was a fashionable pastime among the
      gallants and the gentle of this Elizabethan day, and joint authorship a
      familiar feature in Elizabethan letters. It is said that the great dramas
      we call Shakespeare's so persistently nowadays, and which began to appear
      unheralded at about this time, bear internal traces of courtly and
      aristocratic authorship. The diction is stately and sedate. No
      peasant-born author could have assumed and sustained so haughty a contempt
      for every thing below a baronet (for only at least that grade of humanity&mdash;it
      is said by those who have carefully examined the drama in this view *&mdash;does
      any virtuous or praiseworthy attribute appear in a Shakespearean
      character: while every thing below is exceedingly comic and irresistible,
      but still "base, common, and popular").

    <p>
      If certain noblemen of the court proposed amusing themselves at joint
      anonymous authorship, they were certainly right in concluding that the
      name of a living <span class="pagenum">284</span><a name="link284"
      id="link284"></a>man, in their own pay, was a safer disguise than a
      pseudonym which would challenge curiosity and speculation. At least&mdash;so
      say the New Theorists&mdash;such has turned out to be the actual fact. It
      is the New Theory that, while in employment in the theater, William
      Shakespeare was approached by certain gentlemen of the court. Perhaps
      their names were Southampton, Raleigh, Essex, Rutland, and Montgomery, and
      possibly among them was a needy and ambitious scholar named Bacon, who,
      with an eye to preferment, maintained their society by secret recourse to
      the Jews or to any thing that would put gold for the day in his purse.
      Possibly they desired to be unknown, for the reasons given by Miss Bacon.
      In what they asked of him, and what he did for them, he found, at any
      rate, his profit. The story goes that the amount of profit he realized
      from one of these gentlemen alone was no less a sum than a thousand
      pounds. If so&mdash;considering the buying power of pounds in those days&mdash;it
      is not so wonderful that, at this rate, William Shakespeare retired with a
      fortune. Even at its most and its best, it is an infinitely small
      percentum of the world's wealth that finds its way into the poet's pocket;
      poetasters are sometimes luckier than poets. That William Shakespeare's
      fortune came faster than the fortune of his fellows we do know. This was
      at once the most secure and the most lucrative use he could have made of
      his name. For, as we have seen, owing to the condition of the common law,
      while he could hardly have protected himself against any piracy of his
      name by injunction, he might have loaned it for value to the printers, or
      to any one desirous of employing it, the <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>risk of piracy to be the borrower's. If
      these noble gentlemen desired to write political philosophy&mdash;as Miss
      Bacon believed, or belles lettres for their own pleasure&mdash;they had
      their opportunity now; and the new theory is not inconsistent, either with
      the Delia Bacon theory or with the Baconian theory proper, as elaborated
      by Judge Holmes, who recognizes Bacon's pen so constantly throughout the
      dramas. The same difficulties which those theories meet would still
      confront us if, as Mr. Boucicault and others have suggested, the plays
      were offered from lesser sources, and rewritten entirely by William
      Shakespeare; for we should still be obliged to ask, How did he dare to
      retain in the plays the material which, unintelligible to him, he must
      have believed to be unintelligible to his audiences, as calculated to
      drive them away, rather than to attract them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one of these schemes of assimilated authorship seems at least to tally
      with the evidence from what we know as the "doubtful plays." In 1600,
      there appeared in London an anonymous publication&mdash;a play entitled
      "Troilus and Cressida." It was accompanied by a preface addressed, "A
      never writer to an ever reader," which, in the turgid fashion of the day,
      set forth the merit and attractions of the play itself. Among its other
      claims to public favor, this preface asserted the play to be one "never
      stal'd with the stage, never claperclawed with the palms of the vulgar"&mdash;which
      seems (in English) to mean that it had never been performed in a theater.
      But, however virgin on its appearance in print, it seems to have very
      shortly become "staled with the stage," or, at any rate, with a stage
      name, for, a few months later, <span class="pagenum">286</span><a
      name="link286" id="link286"></a>a second edition of the play (printed from
      the same type) appears, minus the preface, but with the announcement on
      the title-page that this is the play of "Troilus and Cressida, as it was
      enacted by the King's Majesty his servants at the Globe. <i>Written by
      William Shakespeare</i>." * Now, unless we can imagine William Shakespeare&mdash;while
      operating his theater&mdash;writing a play <i>to be published in print</i>&mdash;and
      announcing it as entitled to public favor on the ground that it had never
      been polluted by contact with so unclean and unholy a place as a theater,
      it is hard to escape the conviction that he was not the "never writer"&mdash;in
      other words, that he was not its author at all&mdash;but on its appearance
      in print, levied on it for his stage, underlined it, produced it, and&mdash;it
      proving a success&mdash;either himself announced it, or winked at its
      announcement by others, as a work of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in 1600, a play wras printed in London entitled "Sir John
      Oldcastle" in 1605, one entitled "The London Prodigal" in 1608, one
      entitled "The Yorkshire Tragedy" in 1609, one entitled "Pericles, Prince
      of Tyre;" and, at about the same time, certain others, viz: "The
      Arraignment of Paris;" "Arden of Fever-sham" (a very able work, by the
      way); "Edward III.;" "The Birth of Merlin "Fair Em, the Miller's
      Daughter;" "Mucedorus;" "The Merry Devil of Edmonton;" "The Comedy of
      George a Green;" and "The Two Noble Kinsmen." All the above purported, and
      were understood to be, and were sold as being, works of William
      Shakespeare, except "The Merry Devil of Edmonton," which was announced as
      <span class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>by

    <p>
      Now, it is certainly a fact that William Shakespeare, from his box-office
      at the Globe, or from his country-seat at Stratford, never corroborated
      the printers by admitting, or contradicted them by denying his authorship
      of any of the above enumerated plays. The "Hamlet" had been previously
      published in or about 1603, and the "Lucr√®ce" had made its appearance in
      1594. It is certainly a fact that none of these&mdash;from "Hamlet" to
      "Fair Em," from "Lucrece" to "The Merry Devil of Edmonton"&mdash;did
      William Shakespeare ever either deny or claim as progeny of his. He
      fathered them all as they came, "and no questions asked." And, had Mr.
      Ireland been on hand with his "Vortigern," it might have gone in with the
      rest, with no risk of the scrutiny and the scholarship which exploded it
      so disastrously in 1796. No plays, bearing the name of William Shakespeare
      on their title-page, now appeared from 1609 to 1622. But in the year 1623,
      seven years after William Shakespeare's death, a folio of <i>thirty-six</i>
      plays is brought out by Heminges and Condell, entitled "The Works of Mr.
      William Shakespeare." Of the many plays which had appeared during his
      life, and been circulated and considered as his, or of which mention can
      (according to the Shakes-peareans) be anywhere found, only twenty-six
      appeared in this folio, while ten plays are included which never appear to
      have been seen or heard of until their presence in this Heminges and
      Condell collection. The Shakespeareans allow that this is "mysterious,"
      but precisely the same "mystery" would have been discovered in the days of
      Heminges and Condell them<span class="pagenum">288</span><a name="link288"
      id="link288"></a>selves, if it had been worth the while of anybody then
      living to look into the question. Nothing has happened, since, the death
      of William Shakespeare, to make the Shakespeare question any more
      "mysterious" than he left it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this apparent at a glance, let us present the whole in a tabulated
      statement, only asking the reader to observe that we have in every case
      given the Shakespeareans the benefit of the doubt, and accepted the
      mention of a similar name of any play as proof positive of its being the
      play nowadays attributed to William Shakespeare; and their own chronology
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following table shows the plays passing as William Shakespeare's, in
      London, in the years when he resided in London, as part proprietor and
      concerned in the management of the Globe and Blackfriars Theaters; the
      dates of their earliest mention or appearance, and which of them were
      included in the first folio, edited by Heminges and Condell, in 1628: on
      the supposition that the plays mentioned by Meres (of which, however, no
      other traces can be found, during William Shakespeare's life), besides
      those names in Manningham's and Forman's diaries, and the "Account of the
      Levels at Court," are the identical plays now included in the
      Shakespearean drama. The dates are Mr. Grant White's. <span class="pagenum">289</span><a

     * This play is put in between the Histories and Tragedies,
     as if received "too late for classification," as the
     newspapers say. Its pages are not numbered, and so it does
     not disturb the pagination of the folio.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290" id="link290"></a>A play
      called "Duke Humphrey," attributedto Shakespeare, was amongst the dramatic
      manuscripts destroyed by the carelessness of Warburton's servant, in the
      early part of the last century, as appears by the list preserved in the
      British Museum&mdash;MS. Lans-downe, 849.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving out these plays mentioned by Meres, we then have twenty-one
      entirely new plays, which never appeared in William Shakespeare's life,
      first appearing in Heminges and Condell's edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appearing, then, that, of some forty-two plays credited to William
      Shakespeare during his lifetime, Heminges and Condell selected only
      twenty-five, and printed and hound up with those twenty-five nine plays
      which nobody had ever heard of in print or on the stage or anywhere else,
      until William Shakespeare had been dead and in his grave seven years,
      besides the "Othello," which was first heard of five years after his
      death: it follows either that Heminges and Condell knew that William
      Shakespeare was in the habit of allowing plays to be called by his name
      which he never wrote, or that Heminges and Condell's collection of "Mr.
      William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies, published
      according to the true original copies," is nothing more or less than a
      collection of plays written prior to the year 1623, and not earlier than
      the reign of Elizabeth. The Shakes-peareans may take either horn of the
      dilemma they please. "Pericles," one of the plays rejected by Heminges and
      Condell has since been restored to favor, and no editor now omits it.
      Surely, under the circumstances, we are justified in asking the question:
      "If William Shakespeare ever wrote any plays or <span class="pagenum">291</span><a
      name="link291" id="link291"></a>poems, which of the above did he write,
      and which are 'doubtful?5"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whether the hand that wrote the "Hamlet" also composed the "Fair Em;" or
      the classicist who produced the "Julius C√¶sar" and the "Coriolanus" at
      about the same time achieved "The Merry Devil" and "The London Prodigal,"
      is a question lying within that sacred, peculiar realm of "criticism"
      which has "established" and forever "proved" so many wonderful things
      about "our Shakespeare"&mdash;a realm beyond our purview in these papers,
      and wherein we should be a trespasser. Fortunately, however, the question
      has been settled for us by those to whom criticism is not ultra vies, and
      may safely be said to be at rest now and forever. The burden of the
      judgment of the whole critical world is of record that the only true canon
      of "William Shakespeare" consists of the plays first brought together in
      one book by Heminges and Condell, plus the "Pericles;" and that certain of
      the above-mentioned plays, known to have been published under the name of
      William Shakespeare are "spurious;" that, during the lifetime of William
      Shakespeare, and in the city where he dwelt&mdash;under his very nose,
      that is to say&mdash;divers and sundry plays did appear from time to time
      which he did not write, but which he fathered. Whether, in pure
      philanthrophy and charity, he regarded these as little Japhets in search
      of a father, and so, pitying their abandoned and derelict condition,
      assumed their paternity, or, whether he took advantage of their bastardy
      for mere selfish and ill-gotten gain, the critical world find it
      unprofitable to speculate. But there can be no reasonable doubt that, in
      London in <span class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>the
      days of Elizabeth, in the name of "William Shakespeare" there was much the
      same sort of common trade-mark as exists, in Cologne, in the days of
      Victoria, in the name "Jean Maria Farina"&mdash;that it was at everybody's
      service. And if William Shakespeare farmed ont his name to playwrights,
      just as the only original Farina farms out his to makers of the delectable
      water of Cologne, wherein shall we find fault? If, two hundred years
      after, a lesser Sir Walter of Abbotsford, be acquitted of moral obliquity
      in denying his fatherhood of "Waverly," for the sake of the offspring,
      surely the elastic ethics of authorship, for the sale of the great book,
      will stretch out far enough to cover the case of a Shakespeare, who
      neither affirmed nor denied, but only held his peace! William Shakespeare,
      at least in the days when Lord Coke lays that a play-actor was, in
      contemplation of law, a vagabond and a tramp, * never had to shift for his
      living. He always had money to spend, and money to lend, in the days when
      we know many of his contemporaries in the theatrical and dramatic line
      were "in continued and utter extremity, willing to barter exertion, name,
      and fame for the daily dole that gets the daily dinner. ** Of all the
      co-managers&mdash;and, among them, one Burbage was the Booth or Forrest of
      his day&mdash;William Shakespeare is the only one whose pecuniary success
      enables him to retire to become a landed gentleman with a purchased
      "Esquire" to his name.

      wonder Robert Greene, a well-known contemporary actor, but "who led the
      skeltering life peculiar to his trade! and who had either divined or
      shared the secret of the "Shakespearean" dramas, raised his voice in
      warning of the masquerade in borrowed plumes! Was William Shakespeare a
      shrewd masquerader, who covered his tracks so well that the search for a
      fragment of Shakespearean manuscript or holograph, which has been as
      thorough and ardent as ever was search for the philosopher's stone, has
      been unable to unearth them? Certainly no scrap or morsel has been found.
      The explanation of all this mystery, according to the New Theory, is of
      very little value, except in so far as it throws light upon what otherwise
      seems inexplicable, namely, that these magnificent philosophical dramas
      (which are more precious in our libraries as text-book and poems than as
      stage shows wherewith to pass an idle evening in our enlightened day)
      should have been popular with the coarse audiences of the times from which
      they date. Rut, if, to conceal their real authors, these magnificent
      productions were simply sent out under a name that was at every body's
      disposal, the discovery is of exceeding interest. From the lofty
      masterpiece of the "Hamlet" to what M. Taine calls "a debauch of
      imagination... which no fair and frail dame in London should be without" *&mdash;the
      "Venus and Adonis"&mdash;it was immaterial what they printed as his, so

      We believe that historical and circumstantial evidence alone is adequate
      to settle or even to disturb this Shakespearean question; for it appears
      to be the unanimous verdict of criticism that the style of Bacon and the
      style of "Shakespeare" are as far apart as the poles. Experts have even
      gone so far as to reduce both to a "euphonic test," * and pronounce it
      impossible that the two could have been written by the same hand. But this
      is not very valuable as evidence; for never, we think, can mere expert
      evidence be of itself sufficient as to questions of forgery of authorship
      any more than of autograph. If mere literary style had been all the
      evidence accessible, our Shakespeareans would have been making oath to the
      Ireland forgeries to-day as stoutly as when, in the simplicity of their
      hearts, they swore the impromptus of a boy of eighteen surpassed any thing
      in "Hamlet" or Holy Writ. Even Mr. Spedding, who ignores any "Baconian
      Theory," in writing the life of Bacon, admits that whenever a literary
      doubt has to be decided by the test of style, "the reader must be allowed
      to judge for himself."

      Roman instead of Arabic numerals! etc.) that the Ireland imposture was
      exploded. Forgery is the imitation of an original, and, If the original be
      inimitable, there can surely be no forgery. In the case of forgery of a
      signature, lawyers and experts know that the nearer the imitation, the
      more easy is it detectable; for no man writes his own name twice precisely
      alike, and, if two signatures attributed to the same hand are found to be
      <i>fac similes</i>, and, on being superimposed against the light, match
      each other in every detail, it is irrefutable evidence that one is
      intentionally simulated. * In the case of literary style, however, we are
      deprived of this safeguard, because, the more nearly exact the
      counterfeit, the more easily the critic is deceived. Pope was not afraid

      Ireland, and Macpherson forgeries, but the history of merely sportive

      Were the question before us, "Was the author of these works a poet,
      statesman, philosopher, lawyer?" etc., etc., this internal evidence would
      be, indeed, invaluable. But it is not. The question is not <i>what</i>,
      but <i>who</i>, was the author. Was his family name "Shakespeare," and was
      he christened "William"? The Shakespearean has been allowed to confound
      these questions, and to answer them together, until they have become as
      inseparable as Demosthenes and his pebble-stones. But, once separated, it
      is manifest that the internal evidence drawn from the works themselves,
      however satisfactory as to the one question, is utterly incompetent as to
      the other, and that it is by purely external&mdash;that is to say, by
      circumstantial evidence, by history, and by the record&mdash;that the
      question before us must be answered, if, indeed, it ever is to be answered
      at all. And, therefore, it is by circumstantial evidence alone, we think,
      that literary imposture can be satisfactorily exposed. Neither can we
      trust to internal evidence alone; for an attempt to write the biography of
      William Shakespeare by means of the internal evidence of the Shakespearean
      plays, has inevitably resulted in the questions we have already
      encountered. Was Shakespeare a lawyer, was Shakespeare a physician&mdash;a
      natural philosopher&mdash;a chemist&mdash;a botanist&mdash;a classical
      scholar&mdash;a student of contemporary life and manners&mdash;an
      historian&mdash;a courtier&mdash;an aristocrat&mdash;a biblicist&mdash;a
      journeyman printer, and the rest!&mdash;and in giving us the fairy stories
      of Mr. Knight and Mr. De Quincy in place of the truth we crave. For we can
      not close our eyes to the fact that history very decid<span class="pagenum">297</span><a
      name="link297" id="link297"></a>edly negatives the idea that William
      Shakespeare, of Stratford, was either a lawyer, a physician, a courtier, a
      philosopher, an aristocrat, or a soldier. Moreover, while the internal
      evidence is fatal to the Shakespearean theory, it preponderates in favor
      of the Baconians: for, when we should ask these questions concerning
      Francis Bacon, surely the answer of history would be, Yes&mdash;yes,
      indeed; all this was Francis Bacon. The minute induction of his new and
      vast philosophy did not neglect the analysis of the meanest herb or the
      humblest fragment of experimental truth that could minister to the comfort
      or the health of man. And where else, in the range of letters&mdash;except
      in the Shakespearean works, where kings and clowns alike take their
      figures of speech from the analogies of nature&mdash;is the parallel of
      all this faithful accumulation of detail and counterfeit handwriting of
      Nature? The great ex-chancellor had stooped to watch even the "red-hipped
      bumble-bee" and the "small gray-coated gnat." Had the busy manager been
      studying them as well? His last act on earth was to alight from his
      carriage to gather handfuls of snow, to ascertain if snow could be
      utilized to prevent decomposition of dead flesh; and it is related that,
      in his dying moments&mdash;for the very act precipitated the fever of
      which he died&mdash;he did not forget, to record that the experiment had
      succeeded "excellently well." From these to lordly music, * and in all the
      range between, no science had escaped Francis Bacon. Had the busy <span
      class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a>manager
      followed or preceded the philosopher's footsteps, step by step, up through
      them all?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ulrici, p. 248, book ii, Chapter vi., refers to "Two
     Gentlemen of Verona," Act 1, Sc. 2. as proving that the
     author of that play "possessed in an unusual degree the
     power of judging and understanding the theory of music."
</pre>
    <p>
      And did he pause in his conception or adaptation of a play, pen in hand,
      to take a trip to Italy, or a run-up into Scotland to get the name of a
      hostelry or the topography of a highway, to make it an encyclopaedia as
      well as a play as he went along? If the manager alone was the author of
      these works, there is, we have seen, no refuge from this conviction. But,
      if, as is the New Theory, those plays were amplified for the press by a
      learned hand, perhaps, after all, he was the stage manager, actor, and
      human being that history asserts him to have been. If, as has been
      conjectured, William Shakespeare sketched the clowns and wenches with
      which these stately dramas are relieved, it would account for the supposed
      Warwickshire source of many of them. And if William Shakespeare was pretty
      familiar with the constabulary along his route between home and theater,
      so often traveled by himself and jolly coetaneans with heads full of
      Marian Hackett's ale, and thought some of them good enough to put into a
      play, his judgment has received the approval of many audiences beside
      those of the Bankside and Blackfriars. The Shakespearean plays, as now
      performed in our theaters, are the editions of Cibber, Garrick, Kemble,
      Kean, Macready, Booth, Irving, and others, and, while preserving still the
      dialogues which passed, perhaps, through Shakespeare's hands, retain no
      traces of his industry, once so valuable to the Globe and Blackfriars, but
      now rejected as unsuited to the exigencies of the modern stage, the
      "business" inserted in them by William Shakespeare's editorship has long
      since been rejected. Little as there is of the man of <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>Stratford in our libraries, there is still
      less of him in our theaters in 1881. But the world still retains the
      honest Dogberry, who lived at Grendon, in Bucks, on the road from London
      to Stratfordtown, and doubtless many more of the witty manager's master
      strokes. At least, the "New Theory" and the "Delia Bacon Theory" coincide
      in this, that William Shakespeare was fortunate in the manuscripts brought
      to him, and grew rich in making plays out of them and matching them to his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, briefly sketched, are the theories concerning these glorious
      transcripts of the age of Elizabeth, which, while two centuries of
      literature between is obsolete and moribund, are yet unwithered and
      unstaled, and the most priceless of all the treasuries of the age of
      Victoria. And yet, there seems to be a feeling that any exploration after
      their authorship is a sacrilege, and that this particular historical
      question must be left untouched&mdash;as Pythagoras would not eat beans,
      as parricidal&mdash;that William Shakespeare is William Shakespeare&mdash;and
      the doggerel curse of Stratford hangs over and forefends the meddling with
      his bones. But no witch's palindrome for long can block the march of
      reason and of research. Modern scholarship is every day dissolving
      chimera, and, if this Shakespeare story has no basis of truth, it must
      inevitably be abolished along with the rest. If this transcendent
      literature had come down to us without the name, would it have been
      sacrilege to search for its paternity? And does the mere name of William
      Shakespeare make that, which is otherwise expedient, infamous? <span
      class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a>Or, is this
      the meaning of the incantation on the tomb&mdash;that cursed shall he be
      that seeks to penetrate the secret of the plays? Such, indeed, was the
      belief that drove poor Delia Bacon mad. But we decline to see any thing
      but the calm historical question. It seems to us that, if we are at
      liberty to dispute as much as we like as to whether two a's or only one,
      or three e's or only two belong of right in the name "Shakespeare," surely
      it can not be debarred us to ask of the Past the origin of the
      thousand-souled pages we call by that name. We believe that, if the
      existence of these three theories&mdash;as to each of which it is possible
      to say so much&mdash;proves any thing, it proves that history and
      circumstantial evidence oppose the possibility of William Shakespeare's
      authorship of the works called his, and that there is a reasonable doubt
      as to whether any one man did write, or could have written, either with or
      without a Bodleian or an Astor Library at his elbow, the whole complete
      canon of the Shakespearean works.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is there not a refuge from all these more or less conflicting theories
      in the simple canon that human experience is a safer guide than conjecture
      or miracle? In our own day, the astute manager draws from bushels of
      manuscript plays, submitted to him by ambitious amateurs or plodding
      playwrights, the few morsels he deems worthy of his stage, and,
      restringing them on a thread of his own, or another's, presents the result
      to his audiences. Can we imagine a reason why the same process should have
      been improbable in the days of Elizabeth and James? And if among these
      amateurs and playwrights there happened to be the same proportion of
      lawyers, courtiers, politicians, <span class="pagenum">301</span><a
      name="link301" id="link301"></a>soldiers, musicians, physicians,
      naturalists, botanists, and the rest (as well as contributions from the
      hundreds of learned clerks whom the disestablishment of the monasteries
      had driven to their wits for support), that we would be likely to find
      among the corresponding class to-day, it would surely be a less violent
      explanation of "the myriad-minded Shakespeare," than to conjecture the
      "Shakespeare" springing, without an interval for preparation, at once into
      the finished crown and acme of each and all of these. In fact, is it not
      William Shakespeare the editor, and not the author, to whom our veneration
      and gratitude is due?
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost seems as if not only the skepticism of the doubter but the
      criticism of scholarship has all along tended irresistibly to accept this
      compromise, as all criticism must eventually coincide with history, if it
      be criticism at all. The closest examination of the Shakespearean plays
      has revealed to scholars traces of more than one hand. It is past a
      hundred years since Theobald declared that, "though there are several
      master strokes in these three plays (viz.: the three parts of 'King Henry
      VI.'), yet I am almost doubtful whether they were entirely of his
      (Shakespeare's) writing. And unless they were wrote by him very early, I
      should rather imagine them to have been brought to him as a director of
      the stage, and so have received some finishing beauties at his hands. An
      accurate observer will easily see the diction of them is more obsolete,
      and the numbers more mean and prosaical than in the generality of his
      genuine composition." *

      We have elsewhere shown <span class="pagenum">302</span><a name="link302"
      id="link302"></a>that Farmer stumbled upon the same difficulty. Malone
      "wrote a long dissertation," says Mr. Grant White, "to show that the three
      parts of 'King Henry VI.' were not Shakespeare's, but had only been
      altered and enriched by him; and that the first 'part' was written by
      another person than the author of the second and third."* Drake proposed
      that the "First Part of 'King Henry VI.' be excluded from future editions
      of Shakespeare's Works, because it offers no trace of any finishing
      strokes from the master bard." ** "It remains to inquire," says Hallam
      (after a discussion of these plays, which he says Shakespeare remodeled
      from two old plays "in great part Marlowe, though Greene seems to have put
      in for some share in their composition"), "who are to claim the credit of
      these other plays, so great a portion of which has passed with the world
      for the genuine work of Shakespeare." *** And again, what share he
      (Shakespeare) may have had in similar repairs of the many plays he
      represented, can not be determined. **** And Dyee, Halliwell, and all the
      others follow Mr. Hallam (whose authority' is Greene's well-known
      complaint about the "Johannes Factotum, who struts about with his tyger's
      heart wrapped in a player's hide;" *v which allusion to a line in the
      third part of Henry the Sixth, locates the particular "steal" which Greene
      had most at heart when he complained).

      Last of all comes Mr. <span class="pagenum">303</span><a name="link303"
      id="link303"></a>Grant White, a most profound believer in Shakespeare, and
      all that name implies! with "An Essay on the authorship of the Three Parts
      of King Henry the Sixth," * to prove that William Shakespeare, in
      plagiarizing from the earlier tragedies, only plagiarized from himself, he
      himself having really written all that was worth saving in them! Mr. White
      labors considerably to fix the exact date at which Marlowe, Peale and
      Greene&mdash;the most eminent play writers of the day&mdash;employed a raw
      Stratford youth, just truanting in London, to kindly run over, prune, and
      perfect their manuscripts for them, and to clear Mr. White's Shakespeare
      from the stigma of what, if true, Mr. White admits to have been a "want of
      probity on Shakespeare's part, accompanied by a hardly less culpable
      indifference on the part of his fellows." ** This "indifference" can not
      be charged to one sufferer, at least, Robert Greene, who was not silent
      when he saw his work unblushingly appropriated: thus giving us assurance
      of one occasion, at least, upon which William Shakespeare posed as editor
      instead of author.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, we have seen the circumstantial evidence has been
      corroborated by the experts (for so, to borrow a figure, let us call them)
      Aubrey, Cartwright, Digges, Denham, Fuller, *** and Ben Jonson.

      All these assure us (Ben Jonson twice, once in writing and once in
      conversation) that William Shakespeare was a nat<span class="pagenum">304</span><a
      name="link304" id="link304"></a>ural wit&mdash;a wag in the crude&mdash;but
      that he wanted art. Old Dominie Ward made a note "to read Shakespeare's
      plays to post him," but even he had heard that he was a wit, but that he
      wanted art. * This testimony may not compel conviction, but it is all we
      have; we must take it, or go without any testimony at all. At any rate, it
      sustains and is sustained by the circumstances, and these seven different
      witnesses, at least, testify, without procurement, collusion, or knowledge
      of the use to be made of their testimony, and opposed to them all is only
      the little elegiac rhyme by one of themselves:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Yet must I not give nature all thy art,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one single scrap of mortuary effusion on which to hang the fame of
      centuries! And if we exclude the circumstantial evidence and the expert
      testimony as false, and admit the one little rhyme as true, then our
      reason, judgment, and inner consciousness must accept as the author of the
      learned, laborious, accurate, eloquent, and majestic Sheakespearean pages,
      a wag&mdash;a funny fellow whose "wit (to quote Jonson again) was in his
      own power," but not "the rule of it," so much so, "that sometimes it was
      necessary he should be stopped."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Ante, page 68.
</pre>
    <p>
      Surely it is a much less violent supposition that this funny Mr.
      Shakespeare&mdash;who happened to be employed in the theater where certain
      masterpieces were taken to be cut up into plays to copy out of them each
      actor's parts&mdash;that this waggish penman, as he wrote out the parts in
      big, round hand, improved on or interpolated a palpable hit, a merry
      speech, the <span class="pagenum">305</span><a name="link305" id="link305"></a>last
      popular song, or sketched entire a role with a name familiar to his boyish
      ear&mdash;the village butt, or sot, or justice of the peace, * may he; or,
      why not some fellow scapegrace of olden times by Avon banks? He did it
      with a swift touch and a mellow humor that relieved and refreshed the
      stately speeches, making the play all the more available and the copyist
      all the more valuable to the management. But, all the same, how this witty
      Mr. Shakespeare would have roared at a suggestion that the centuries after
      him should christen by his&mdash;the copyist's&mdash;name all the might
      and majesty and splendor, all the philosophy and pathos and poetry, every
      word that he wrote out, unblotting a line, for the players!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * He had not failed to see Dogberry and Shallow in the
     little villages of Warwickshire&mdash;and the wonderful "Watch."
     The "Watch" of those days was indeed something to wonder at.
     In a letter of Lord Burleigh to Sir Francis Walsingham,
     written in 1586, the writer says that he once saw certain of
     them standing "so openly in pumps" in a public place, that
     "no suspected person would come nigh them;" and, on his
     asking them what they stood there for, they answered that
     they were put there to apprehend three men, the only
     description they had of them was that one of them had a
     hooked nose. "If they be no better instructed but to find
     three persons by one of them having a hooked nose, they may
     miss thereof," reflects Burghley, with much reason. Mr.
     Halliwell Phillips, in his "Outline of the Life of William
     Shakespeare" (Brighton, 1881), page 66, thinks that this is
     unlikely, because the magistrate mentioned by Aubrey would
     have been too old in 1642, if he had been the model sought.
</pre>
    <p>
      It must be conceded, say the new theorists:
    </p>
    <p>
      I. That the plays, whether in the shape we now have them or not, are, at
      least, under the same <span class="pagenum">306</span><a name="link306"
      id="link306"></a>names and with substantially the same dramatis person√¶.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. That William Shakespeare was the stage manager, or stage editor; or,
      at any rate, touched up the plays for representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. That the acting copies of the plays, put into the hands of the
      players to learn their parts from, were more or less in the handwriting of
      William Shakespeare, and that from these acting copies the first folio of
      1623 was set up and printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, the best evidence at hand seems to establish all three of these
      propositions. This evidence is meager and accidental, but, for that very
      reason, involuntary, and, therefore, not manufactured; and it establishes
      the above propositions, as far as it goes, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      I. In a volume, "Poste, with a racket of Madde-Letters," printed in 1603,
      a young woman is made to say to her lover: "It is not your liustie rustie
      can make me afraide of your big lookes, for I saw the plaie of Ancient
      Pistoll, where a craking coward was well cudgelled for his knavery; your
      railing is so near the rascall that I am almost ashamed to bestow so good
      a name as the rogue upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, Sharpham, in his "Fleire," printed in 1607, has this piece of
      dialogue:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Kni</i>.&mdash;And how lives he with 'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Fie</i>.&mdash;Faith, like This be in the play, a' has almost killed
      himselfe with the scabbard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The first author thus makes his young woman to have seen Henry V., and the
      second alludes to the Midsummer-Night's Dream, where the bumpkin is made
      to kill himself by falling on his <span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a>scabbard instead of his sword. Besides, in
      the imperfect versions of the plays which the printers were able to make
      up, from such unauthorized sources as best served them, it is thought that
      there are unmistakable evidences that one of the sources was the shorthand
      of a listener, who, not catching a word or phrase distinctly, would put
      down something that sounded enough like it to betray the sources and his
      copy. For example: In the spring of 1602, a play called "The Revenge of
      Hamlet, Prince of Denmark." was presented at the Globe theater. In 1603,
      two booksellers, Ling and Trundell, printed a play of that title, put
      William Shakespeare's name to it, and sold it. Now, in this version, we
      have such errors as "right done" for "write down" (Act I., Scene ii.);
      "invenom'd speech" for "in venom steeped" (Act I., Scene i.); "I'll
      provide for you a grave" for "most secret and most grave" (Act III, Scene
      iv.); "a beast devoid of reason" for "a beast that wants discourse of
      reason," and the like. Ling and Trundell, somehow or other, procured
      better copy, and printed a corrected edition in the following year; but
      the errors in their first edition were precisely such as would result from
      an attempt to report the play phonetically, as it was delivered by the
      actors on the stage. All the printers of the day seem to have made common
      piracy out of these plays, impelled thereto by their exceeding popularity.
      Hash says that the first part of King Henry VI., especially, had a
      wonderful run for those days, being witnessed by at least ten thousand
      people. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We take all these references from "Outlines of the Life of
     Shakespeare," by I. O. Halliwell Phillips (Brighton. Printed
     for the author's friends, for presents only. 1881), page 40,
     to which capital volume we acknowledge our exceeding
     obligation. Mr. Grant White in the Atlantic Monthly, October
     1881, believes that he is able to trace the surreptitious
     "copy" of this first Hamlet to the actor who took the part
     of Voltimand. The inference from Mr. White's account of the
     transaction, is precisely that we have noted in the text.

    <p>
      Of <span class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>this
      play a garbled version was put on the market by Millington, who, soon
      after, did the same thing by the Henry V.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. Davenant instructed Betterton how to render the part of Henry VIII.,
      assuring him that he (Davenant) had his own instructions from Lowin, and
      that Lowin got them from William Shakespeare in person. * (We have not
      accepted Davenant's evidence as likely to be of much value, when assuming
      to be Shakespeare's son, successor, literary executor, and the like, but
      this does not appear, on its face, improbable, and is no particular less
      if untrue.) Ravens-croft, who re-wrote Titus Andronicus in 1687, says, in
      his preface: "I have been told by some anciently conversant with the
      stage, that it (this play) was not originally his (Shakespeare's), but
      brought by a private actor to be acted, and he only gave some master
      touches to one or two of the principal parts or characters." **
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am assured," says Gildon, *** "from very good hands, that the person
      that acted Iago was in much esteem as a comedian, which made Shakespeare
      put several words and expressions into his part, perhaps not so agreeable
      to his character, to make the audience laugh, who had not yet learned to
      endure to be serious a whole play."

      (But if Shakespeare put them in to "catch the ear of the groundlings," who
      took <span class="pagenum">309</span><a name="link309" id="link309"></a>them
      out again for the folio of 1623? The Baconians would probably ask: "Did
      Bacon, after Shakespeare was dead?" And it could not have been a
      proofreader; for, if there was any proof-reader, he was the most careless
      one that ever lived. The folio of 1623 is crowded with typographical
      errors.) Somebody&mdash;necessarily Shakespeare&mdash;was in the habit of
      introducing into these Shakespearean plays the popular songs of the day.
      For example, the song, "A Lover and His Lass," in "As you Like it." was
      written by Thomas Morley, and printed in his "First Book of Ayres; or,
      Little Short Songs," in 1600. * And the ballad, "Farewell, Dear Love," in
      "Twelfth Night," has previously appeared in 1601, in the "Book of Ayres"
      of Robert Jones. ** It is probable, however, says Mr. Halliwell Phillips,
      that William Shakespeare had withdrawn from the management of the Globe;
      at the date of its destruction during the performance of Henry VIII.
      (which Mr. Phillips calls the first play on the English stage in which
      dramatic art was sacrificed to stage effect. It is curious, this being the
      case, to find the New Shakespeare Society rejecting the Henry VIII. as not
      Shakespearean on the philological evidence, and assuring us that Wolsey's
      soliloquy is not Shakespeare's, as did Mr. Spedding so many years before).

     *  In the last issue of the "Transactions of the New
     Shakespeare Society" is a copy of what purports to be a
     manuscript respecting the delivery of certain red cloth to
     Shakespeare, on the occasion of a reception to James I., by
     the corporation of London, in 1604, unearthed and guaranteed
     by Mr. Furnivall.

     **  Folio, London, 1601.
</pre>
    <p>
      The story of Queen Elizabeth's order for "Falstaff in Love" first
      appeared, in 1702, in the <span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310"
      id="link310"></a>preface to John Dennis's "Comicale Gallant," from whom
      Rowe quoted. Although smacking of the same flavor as the Southampton and
      King James "yarns"&mdash;it is worth noting that this story may possess,
      perhaps, some vestige of foundation. If these sounding plays, so full of
      religion, politics, philosophy, and statecraft, were presented at
      Shakespeare's theater, it is only natural that it should come to
      Elizabeth's ears. The lion Queen did not care to have her subjects
      instructed too far. She liked to keep them well in hand, and was only&mdash;she
      and her ministers&mdash;too ready to "snuff treason in certain things that
      went by other's names." The run of comedies at other theaters were
      harmless enough (an adultery for a plot, and an unsuspecting husband for a
      butt. This was a comedy; plus a little blood, it was a tragedy). Let the
      people have their fill of amusement, but it is better not to meddle with
      philosophy and politics. So there are things more unlikely to have
      happened than that Elizabeth, through her Lord Chamberlain, should have
      intimated to manager Shakespeare to give them something more in the run
      and appetite of the day. * The "Merry Wives of Windsor" was, in due time,
      underlined. But, somehow or other, it was with a would-be adulterer,
      rather than an injured husband, for a butt; and, somehow or other, Galen
      and Esculapius and Epicurius had intruded where there was no need of them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Collier&mdash;"Lives of Shakespeare's Actors, Introduction,
     page xv."&mdash;says that there were at least two, and perhaps
     three, other William Shakespeares in London in these days.
</pre>
    <p>
      The salaciousness Elizabeth wanted (if the story is true) was all there,
      as well as the transformation scene; but, at the end, there is a re<span
      class="pagenum">311</span><a name="link311" id="link311"></a>buke to
      lechery and to lecherous minds that is not equivocal in its terms. * But
      that any of this Shakespeare fortune came, by way of gift or otherwise,
      from Southampton, there is no ground, except silly and baseless rumor, for
      believing. If Southampton had been the Rothschild of his time&mdash;which
      he was very far from being&mdash;he would not have given a thousand pounds
      (a sum we have estimated as equaling $25,000 to-day, but which Mr. Grant
      White puts at $30,000, and which Mr. Halliwell Phillips, ** on account of
      the "often fictitious importance attached to cash, arising from its
      comparative scarcity in those days," says ought even be as high as twelve
      pounds for one) to a casual acquaintance. The mere passing of such a sum
      would seem to involve other relations; and if Southampton knew
      Shakespeare, or Shakespeare Southampton, let it be demonstrated from some
      autobiographical or historical source&mdash;from some other source than
      the "Biographies of William Shakespeare," written by those slippery
      rhapsodists, the Shakespereans. If Damon and Pythias were friends, let it
      appear from the biographies of Damon, as well as from the biographies of
      Pythias. Let us find it in some of Southampton's papers, or in the
      archives or papers of some of his family, descendants, contemporaries, or
      acquaintances; in the chronicles of Elizabeth, Raleigh, Cecil, Essex,
      Rutland, Montgomery, Camden, Coke, Bacon, Tobie Mathew, Ben Jonson, or of
      somebody alive and with open eyes in London <span class="pagenum">312</span><a
      name="link312" id="link312"></a>at about that date, before we yield it
      historical assent, and make oath to it so solemnly.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Perhaps, if the story were true, a rebuke to Elizabeth
     personally in the line (Act V., Scene v.), "Our radiant
     Queen hates sluts and sluttery."
</pre>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, and as the industrious Mr. Lodge confesses, * there
      is no such trace or record. Except from, the "biographers" of Shakespeare,
      no note, hint, or surmise, connecting the two names, can be anywhere
      unearthed, and they only draw the suggestion on which they build such
      lofty treatises from a dedication printed in the days when printers helped
      themselves to any name they wanted without fear of an injunction out of
      chancery. That any sonnets were ever dedicated to Southampton by anybody,
      is, we have seen, pure invention.

      III. But that the famous First Folio of 1623 was set up from piecemeal
      parts written for separate actors, and that these were in William
      Shakespeare's handwriting, there seems to be contemporary circumstantial
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that, although Ben Jonson has, for two hundred and fifty
      years, been believed when he said in poetry that William Shakespeare was
      not only the "Star of Poets" for genius, but that besides he would "sweat
      and strike the second heat upon the muses's anvil;" when he said in prose
      that "The players often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare that in
      writing (whatever he wrote) he never blotted out a line," he was supposed
      to be using a mere figure of speech. But it seems that he was telling the
      truth. For, in 1623&mdash;Shakespeare having been dead seven years&mdash;Heminges
      and Condell&mdash;two "players" (i. e., <span class="pagenum">313</span><a
      name="link313" id="link313"></a>actors), and the same that Shakespeare in
      his Will calls his "fellows"&mdash;publish the first edition of the plays
      we now call "Shakespeare"&mdash;and, on the title-page of that edition,
      advertise them as "published according to the <i>true original copies</i>."
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      Further on in their preface, they repeat, almost in his very words, Ben
      Jon-son's statement, asserting that "We have scarce received from him
      (William Shakespeare) a blot in his papers." What papers? What indeed, but
      "the true original copies" of these plays which were in William
      Shakespeare's handwriting? What else could it have been that "the players"
      (according to Ben Jonson) saw? Does anybody suppose that the poet's own
      first draft, untouched of the file and unperfumed of the lamp, went into
      "the players'" hands, for them to learn their parts from? And, even if <i>one</i>
      player was allowed to study his part from the inspired author's first
      draft, his fellow "players" must have taken or received a copy or copies
      of their parts; they could not all study their parts from the same
      manuscript. The only reasonable supposition, therefore, is, that William
      Shakespeare made it part of his duties at the theater to <i>write out</i>
      in a fair hand the parts for the different "players" (and no wonder they
      mentioned it, as "an honor" to him, that he lightened their labors
      considerably by the legibility of his penmanship, by never blotting out a
      line) and that, in course of time, these "true original copies" were
      collected from their fellow-actors by Heminges and Condell, and by them
      published; they remarking, in turn, upon the excellence of the penmanship
      so familiar to them. There is only wanted to confirm this supposition, a
      piece of <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a>actual
      evidence as to what Heminges and Condell <i>did</i> print from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it happens that, by their own careless proof reading, Heminges and
      Condell have actually supplied this piece of missing circumstantial
      evidence, as follows: Naturally, in these true original copies of a
      particular actors part, the name of the actor assuming that part would be
      written in the margin, opposite to or instead of the name of the character
      he was to personate; precisely as is done to-day by the theater copyist in
      copying parts for distribution among the company. It happened that, in
      setting up the types for this first edition from these fragmentary actors'
      copies, the printers would often accidentaly, from following "copy" too
      closely, set up these real names of the actors instead of the names of the
      characters. And&mdash;as any one taking up a copy or fac-simile of this
      famous "first folio" can see for himself&mdash;the editors carelessly
      overlooked these errors in the proof, and there they remain to this day:
      "Jacke Wilson," for "Balthazar," "Andrew" and "Cowley," for "Dogberry;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kempe," for "Verges," and the like&mdash;the names of Shakespeare's
      actors&mdash;instead of the parts they took in the piece. It seems
      superfluous to again suggest that these unblotted "copies" could not have
      been the author's first draft of a play, or that an author does not write
      his compositions in manifold, or that there had been many actors to learn
      their parts in the course of from sixteen to twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides&mdash;even if Heminges and Condell had not told us&mdash;it would
      have still been perfectly evident, from an inspection of the "first
      folio," that the "copy" it was set up from was never completely in their
      hands, but <span class="pagenum">315</span><a name="link315" id="link315"></a>was
      collected piecemeal during the manufacture. For instance, we see where the
      printers left a space of twenty-nine pages, between "Romeo and Juliet" and
      "Julius C√¶sar," in which to print the "Timon of Athens." But all the copy
      they could find of the "Timon" only made <i>eighteen</i> pages, and so&mdash;by
      huge "head pieces" and "tail pieces," and a "Table of the Actor's Names"
      (given in no other instance) in coarse capitals&mdash;they eked out the
      "signature;" and, by omitting the whole of the next "signature," carried
      the pagination over from "98" to "109." The copy for "Troilus and
      Cres-sida" seems not to have been received until the volume was in the
      binder's hands (which is remarkable, too, for that play had been in print
      for fourteen years). The play is not mentioned in the table of contents,
      but is tucked in without paging (except that the first five pages are
      numbered 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, whereas the paging of the volume had already
      reached 232). "Troilus and Cressida," thus printed, fills two "signatures"
      lacking one page, and so somebody at hand wrote a "Prologue" in rhyme&mdash;setting
      out the argument&mdash;to save the blank page, and the like. Whatever
      "papers" Heminges and Condell "received from William Shakespeare then,
      were fair, unblotted copies of the actor parts, made by him for their use.
      It appears then, that&mdash;minute scholarship and the records apart&mdash;the
      foreman of a printing-house would have been at any time in the past two
      hundred and fifty years, without assistance from the commentators, able to
      settle the great Shakespearean authorship controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While&mdash;from one standpoint&mdash;this testimony of the types is
      strong circumstantial evidence against <span class="pagenum">316</span><a
      name="link316" id="link316"></a>the Baconian theory, taken from another
      standpoint it is quite as strongly corroborative. For on the one hand,
      Bacon was alive when this folio was printed, and the man who rewrote his
      essays eleven times would scarcely have allowed his plays to go to the
      public so shiftlessly printed. But on the other hand, if the book was
      printed without consulting him, that insurmountable barrier&mdash;the fact
      that Bacon never claimed these plays&mdash;is swept away at once. We have
      simply to assume that he always intended, at some convenient season, to
      acknowledge them: that he was not satisfied with them as they appeared in
      the Heminges and Condell edition, and proposed revising them himself
      before claiming them, (we know how difficult he found it to satisfy his
      own censorship) or that he purposed completing the series, (for which the
      sketch of the Henry VII may have been placed among his private memoranda)
      at his leisure. We have then only to imagine that death overtook him
      suddenly (his death was sudden) before this programme had been completed,
      and his not acknowledging them; not leaving them&mdash;incomplete as he
      believed them&mdash;to "the next ages," was characteristic of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I go, who remains? If I remain, who goes?" said Dante to the Council
      of Florence. Take the Shakespearean pages away from English literature,
      and what remains? Detain them, and what departs? And yet are men to
      believe that the writer of these pages left no impress on the history of
      his age and no item in the chronicle of his time? that, in the intensest
      focus of the clear, calm, electric-light of nineteenth century inspection
      and investigation, their author <span class="pagenum">317</span><a
      name="link317" id="link317"></a>stands only revealed in the gossip of
      goodwives or the drivel of a pot-house clientage? Who is it&mdash;his
      reason and judgment once enlisted&mdash;who believes this thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus discovered the continent we call after the name of another. Where
      shall we find written the names of the genii whose fruit and fame this
      Shakespeare has stolen. Having lost "our Shakespeare" both to-day and
      forever, it will doubtless remain&mdash;as it is&mdash;the question, "Who
      wrote the Shakespearean dramas?" The evidence is all in&mdash;the
      testimony is all taken. Perhaps it is a secret that even Time will never
      tell, that is hidden deep down in the crypt and sacristy of the Past,
      whose seal shall never more be broken. In the wise land of China it is
      said that when a man has deserved well of the state, his countrymen honor,
      with houses and lands and gifts and decorations, not himself, but his
      father and his mother. Perhaps, learning a lesson from the Celestials; we
      might rear a shaft to the fathers and the mothers of the Immortality that
      wrote the Book of Nature, the mighty book which "age can not wither, nor
      custom stale" and whose infinite variety for three centuries has been and,
      until Time shall be no more, will be close to the hearts of every age and
      cycle of men&mdash;household words for ever and ever, The Book&mdash;thank
      heaven!&mdash;that nothing can divorce from us.
